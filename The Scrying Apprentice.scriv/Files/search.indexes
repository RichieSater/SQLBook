            <Text>Legal Dominance:
		Emergency Powers: The Tower of Nature seeks a change in law that grants them emergency powers during crisis times - powers that would effectively make them the governing body of Aeloria.
		Wizard Legislation: They could be pushing for a law that requires all major decisions (political, military, economic) to be approved by a Nature wizard, under the pretext of ensuring alignment with the natural order.
		Anti-Illusion Law: They could be advocating for stringent restrictions or outright bans on the use of illusion magic, claiming it distorts the natural order and hastens the prophecy.
		Realm Restrictions: They may be working to pass a law limiting the Tower of Summoning's ability to contact other realms, arguing that these interactions risk attracting unwanted attention or even accelerating the prophecy.
		Scrying Controls: The Tower of Nature might propose that all scrying activities be regulated and monitored by them to ensure they're used responsibly and not exacerbating the crisis.
Resource Acquisition:
		Magical Resources: They could be plotting to take control of rare magical resources, claiming that these are essential for their rituals to prevent the prophecy.
		Labor Force: The Tower could be seeking to conscript a significant portion of the population under the guise of preparing for the prophecy, essentially gaining a large workforce.
		Land Acquisition: They could aim to seize control of vast lands, justifying that they need more space for magical experiments, or to cultivate unique plants used in their rituals.
		Control of Gold Reserves: The Tower might be working to amass large amounts of gold under the premise of funding efforts to avert the prophecy, providing them with vast wealth.
		Strategic Sites: They could be seeking control over strategic sites like ports, mines, and fortresses, claiming they're necessary for defensive measures against the forthcoming doom.

            <Title>Ava</Title>
            <Synopsis>PRIOR TO THE SCENE
Ava, the village herbalist's dynamic and perceptive daughter, has been a fixture in Aiden's life since childhood. With her waves of chestnut hair and eyes reflecting the tranquil hue of the river, she is a living testament to their homeland's beauty. She navigates a world of therapeutic herbs and healing concoctions, her evenings filled with prayers to the Earth – a universe that has always intrigued Aiden.

Their relationship is a woven tapestry of shared dreams, hearty laughter, good-natured banter, and a subtly blossoming affection. While Aiden tends to be more reserved, Ava is an open book. Her fondness for Aiden is evident in her radiant smiles, thoughtful gestures, and the spark that lights her eyes when she looks at him.

Aiden and Ava spend many tranquil evenings together in her verdant garden. As twilight unfurls its calm, they find solace among the whispering herbs. Aiden assists Ava with the plants, his curiosity piqued by her vast knowledge and the reverence she shows towards nature's healing powers.

It is during these intimate moments that Ava's feelings for Aiden become particularly pronounced. The affectionate glances she casts his way as they share stories under the stars, the fleeting touches as they exchange garden tools, and her unwavering interest in his work in the candle shop are clear indications of her deep-seated affection.

One memorable evening, Ava gifts Aiden a candle infused with a rare herb. "For a brighter light and pleasant dreams," she murmurs, a soft blush tinting her cheeks. Aiden accepts the gift, their fingers brushing momentarily, his heart catching at the tender sentiment. His warm smile of gratitude makes Ava's heart flutter in response.

Through Ava, we explore a character who embodies courage and love, unafraid to express her feelings. Her palpable affection for Aiden encourages him to gradually acknowledge his own emotions, adding a hint of sweet romance to their intertwined narrative.</Synopsis>
            <Text>II.  Ava

The sun is just beginning to cast its first rays over the village, casting a golden hue over the sleepy hamlet. Aiden, having finished his morning chores at home, makes his way towards the river, where he knows Ava will be gathering herbs for the day.

Upon reaching the riverbank, he finds Ava already engrossed in her work. Her hands move with practiced ease, plucking herbs and gently placing them into her woven basket. On seeing Aiden, her face lights up. "You're early today," she remarks, her voice as soothing as the river's song.

They spend a few moments in companionable silence, Aiden helping Ava with her gathering. Then, as if remembering something, Ava suddenly grows quiet. Aiden, noting her change in mood, looks at her quizzically.

"It's just..." she begins, struggling to find the right words. "Have you heard about the 'Great Preparation'?"

Aiden nods, remembering the vague mentions of it in the village. "Something about prioritizing the orders from the Tower of Nature, right?" he asks, unsure.

"Yes," Ava confirms, a tinge of worry in her eyes. "They say it's due to a prophecy...a foretelling of some sort of disaster. Everyone is anxious. Even Mother’s orders for herbs have increased substantially."

She shakes her head slightly, her gaze distant. "I don't understand it all, Aiden. But something doesn't feel right.”

Their conversation is interrupted by the call of a distant bird, signaling the time for Aiden to head to the candle shop. With a final shared glance, they part ways – Ava to her herbs and Aiden to his craft, both carrying with them a sense of unease about the impending changes their village is facing.

            <Title>Plot</Title>
            <Text>A story is about revealing character.  In a thriller it is about how will that character react in a very dramatic situation.  Character is revealed through action.  Try to write every chapter as if it is the first chapter in the book.  We pay a lot of attention to these first chapters because they are very important.   
Write a story not a collection of pretty lines.  Don’t set out to write a book - set out to write a number one book.  You need a number one story idea.  Don’t write a single chapter that doesn’t move the story forward.  
Leave out all the parts that readers would want to skim.  They will skim stuff - if you find yourself writing that - take it out.  Try to write for a single reader who is sitting across the desk from you and you don’t want them to get up until they finish.  If you are smart you will make that reader a woman - women buy 70% of the books.
Condense your plot into something that is manageable very quickly.  Take The Great Gatsby:
1. Gatsby has everything that anyone could ever dream of except love.  
2. Gatsby gets love
3. Gatsby loses love and thus loses everything
That’s The Great Gatsby
"A plot need not be turned into a story any more than a sketch of a scene need be turned into a picture. It is a sketch, not a picture, though, unless the figures in it are bound by some law of causation. The king died, and then the queen died, is a story. The king died, and then the queen died of grief, is a plot." - E.M. Forster
You will hear from your editor that the stakes need to be raised.  What that means is that what is at risk or what can be gained for the character is so significant that the reader feels it emotionally.
If there are no worthy adversaries, then the reader just knows the good guys will win and there are no stakes there.  High stakes must always be a piece of the puzzle.
You must create conflict.  Conflict is the key to drama.  No conflict = no drama.  Even if your character isn’t that heroic he needs a worthy villain or puzzle to contend with.  The puzzle must be as hard for the reader to solve as the character.  Or if you use a villain, the villain must be worthy and perhaps even cleverer or better than your protagonist.  
Another kind of conflict is a love story.  There things that make the relationship untenable are the puzzle that your characters must contend with.  This could be inner demons, or external circumstances that threaten the relationship.
If you have villains in your book they must be worthy opponents.  One way to approach this is a “who did it” where you never see the villain until the end.  The other is to introduce the villain earlier but then he has to be fascinating and three dimensional.  Most villains are not worthy opponents and readers know they will be defeated in a way that isn’t that interesting.  If the “chase” is not interesting then readers will not continue.
Build in Surprises.  You won’t be able to surprise people in every scene — but the reader needs to feel twists and surprises that keep the story from lagging.  Some writers use these more than others, but it is a great device to keep the interest.  
Less is more - as you map out the story stick to the nuggets of the story.  Be able to tell the story in 10 minutes - that is the core of your story.  You will flesh out the characters and narrative of course for the book, but if you can’t tell the story in 10 minutes and it be interesting then there isn’t a book here.</Text>

            <Title>Aiden's Start</Title>
            <Synopsis>Aiden hails from the tranquil fishing village of Marlow's Cove, nestled in a sheltered bay of Aeloria. His parents, Tormund and Maelis, are honest, hardworking fisherfolk who have weathered many a storm together.

Tormund is a burly man with a hearty laugh, the lines of countless smiles etched into his sun-worn face. He is well-known for his incredible skill with the fishing net and his extraordinary stories of mythical sea creatures. Maelis, Aiden's mother, is a strong-willed and loving woman, known throughout the cove for her knack for mending both fishing nets and scraped knees. Their home is modest but filled with warmth and laughter.

Aiden also shares his home with a precocious younger sister, Ayla, whose wit is as quick as her fingers are nimble. She can untangle the trickiest of fishing lines with ease, a skill she often jokes she developed dealing with her older brother.

Before the shift in his destiny, Aiden was an apprentice to Old Brennan, the master boatmaker of Marlow's Cove. Despite his skill and growing reputation as a boatmaker, Aiden always felt a sense of longing for something more, a purpose or adventure beyond the confines of the cove.

Unbeknownst to him, adventure would soon find him in the form of the emissaries of the towers.

As for the love interest, we could introduce Mira. Mira is a childhood friend of Aiden who grew into a beautiful and kind-hearted woman, adept at navigation and astronomy. She has always been Aiden's confidante, their friendship a comforting constant amidst the changing tides of their lives. While neither of them has confessed their feelings, their bond is deeper than the cove's waters.

In terms of adding depth, let's focus on Marlow's Cove. Marlow's Cove could be a microcosm of Aeloria itself. The village is filled with colorful characters, each with their own quirks and stories. The cove is an important trade route, bringing with it merchants and travelers with tales of the grandeur and mysteries of the seven towers, stirring Aiden's dreams of a life beyond. Its location by the sea also symbolizes the vast, uncharted territory that Aiden will soon navigate as he steps into the world of magic and wizardry.

Moreover, the cove can play an important role in defining Aiden's initial character and skills. His work with Brennan has made him patient, meticulous, and innovative. The unpredictable weather and tides of the sea have taught him to be adaptable and resilient. His close-knit community has instilled in him a sense of loyalty and the ability to work with others towards a common goal.

All these traits, his unspoken love for Mira, his bond with his family, and his dreams of grandeur, make Aiden's journey into the world of wizardry not just a quest for truth but also a journey of self-discovery and growth.</Synopsis>

            <Title>Writers Block</Title>
            <Text>The blank page is the enemy.  In the movies they often show this.  They show somebody writing the first line, crossing it out, again and again.  But there is a reality to the blank page being troubling
The solution is to freight train through the first draft.  It should take 1 month.  There are times where it flows out and you think it’s great and times where you force it out and it feels flat.  It doesn’t matter.  Freight train through the first draft.  If the chapter isn’t working, put TK and get it in the next draft.  Freight train through.
Write 7 days a week.  James gets up early in the morning, has a cup of coffee reads the paper and then writes.  Writing could be outlining.  James writes in pencil on a yellow legal pad on every other line, and has his assistant type it up for him.  His assistant types it triple space so he can write between the lines on his next draft.  That way he does his second draft in no time.  James will golf in between writing sessions.  He writes, golfs, writes, has lunch, then writes again.  
It’s useful to be able to tune out your environment and write anywhere.  The best way to be able to do this is to practice it.  It’s not a matter of write anywhere its the ability to concentrate and to start writing on a whim and actually do it.  Multi-tasking isn’t the answer the answer is focused concentration and it’s even better if you can do it anywhere any time.
If you need a break take a break.  Take a week and don’t write.  Put your mind somewhere else to stop the neurosis.  Go to the movies.  Take writing seriously, you probably aren’t writing Ulysses but take it seriously.  Practice, Practice, Practice.  Even if it isn’t that good yet - you are putting in your 10,000 hours and practicing.  The more you write the better you get.  There is a threshold level you have to get too and most people can get their.</Text>

            <Text>VI.  Eavesdropping

Crouching behind a dense thicket, Aiden strained his ears to catch fragments of the conversation unfolding before him. The nature wizard conversed with an unknown figure, their hushed voices interwoven with an air of secrecy.

"The men can't see at night," the nature wizard whispered, a note of urgency threading through his words.

The figure, their identity veiled within the encompassing darkness, responded in a low tone, "I am working on a solution. The search cannot be compromised. The prophecy provides a smokescreen, but we must ensure the others remain oblivious to our true intentions."

"The scryers could unveil it in an instant," one of them suggested, hope lacing their voice.

"Ah, but the scryers possess a keen sight," the other countered, their tone tinged with caution. "They would discern the truth, unraveling the entirety of our operation. We must proceed under the cover of darkness."

Aiden's pulse quickened as he pieced together the fragments of their conversation. The candles served a hidden purpose—a means to aid the nature wizards in their nocturnal quest, shrouded in secrecy to avoid detection.</Text>

            <Title>Creating Characters</Title>
            <Text>If you write something mediocre, chances are it won’t get published.  The only two ways to not write something mediocre is if the idea for the book itself is tremendous or you have created a character or characters who see the world in such a fresh way that the character can sell the book.  People need to love or hate your character SO MUCH.  And that is only possible if the character’s WORLD VIEW makes an impression.  
What goes into a character?  Who in your life do you find interesting?  Why are they interesting?  What about you?  Are you religious?  Are you overweight?  What does that mean for your life - what little ticks does that give you?  What fits your main character and is relevant to your story?  When you figure out something about the character that is exactly right you get excited.
Make a complex hero that people want to read about.  There should be a flaw.  Also make a complex villain.  It has to be a worthy opponent.  They need to be clever.  They need to be able to surprise the reader.  Reader’s ethics and morals will fade away if they are really digging the villain.
What’s interesting is readers will know more about your main characters than they know about people in their own lives - in some cases more than they know about their spouses - in terms of history, how they think, etc.  This is why people love novels, it’s intimate.  But only if you create it.  This character won’t be the most important person in their lives but they should be someone they know so well they will never forget them.</Text>

            <Text>III. Candlemaking

Aiden, working diligently under the careful supervision of his mentor, Elder Thomas labored in the candle shop, the scent of warm wax and soothing herbs filling the air. Yet, the comforting routine was shattered when the door of the workshop swung open to reveal a figure from the Tower of Nature.

"I'm here for the order," the wizard stated, his voice like the rustling of leaves. His gaze turned to the candles, the shop's prized creations.

Elder Thomas, though surprised, managed a respectful bow. "We're working as fast as we can. The new batch will be ready by the week's end."

The wizard's face hardened. “As you know Elder, The impending times demand more light.  I need twice the usual quantity, Elder Thomas, by the same deadline."

A gasp escaped Aiden. Doubled? It was impossible!

Elder Thomas, too, looked shocked. "But...we don't have the means. The wax, the wicks—it's impossible!"

A cold smile spread on the wizard's face. "According to the new edicts, failure to meet orders requisitioned for 'The Great Preparation' is considered a high crime, punishable by incarceration."

            <Synopsis>Database: Realities such as the mirror world or the base world. Each reality holds different concepts, which are the tables.

Tables: Concepts like humans, vampires, armies,, etc. These are groups of related entities that wizards can scry upon.

Rows: Individual entities or items within each concept. For example, each human or vampire is a row in their respective tables. 

Columns: These are the unique attributes of each entity. For example, a human might have columns like name, age, location, magical_ability, etc. 

Primary Key: A unique magical sigil or identifier that uniquely identifies each entity or event in a concept (table).  Will use astro-coordinates because numbers are boring.

Foreign Key: A magical link or connection that ties an entity or event in one concept (table) to an entity or event in another. 

Index: A magical guide or map that helps wizards find and access the information quickly, e.g., quickly finding a specific vampire or contract.

Query: The act of scrying itself, where Eamon uses the Mirror of Data to view, modify, or interact with the entities within the realities.

Functions (like COUNT, AVG, etc.): These could be advanced scrying techniques or spells that Eamon learns to derive new insights from his observations. For instance, COUNT might let Eamon quickly ascertain the number of soldiers in an army.

Joins: Spells that Aiden uses to merge visions from different concepts (tables) into one. For instance, finding the link between a vampire and a specific contract.

Transactions: A series of related scrying events or magical operations. For example, Eamon might begin a transaction to solve a mystery, which involves multiple scrying operations that must all succeed or all fail.

Views: Commonly used or saved scrying visions/spells that allow wizards to quickly revisit or reuse specific insights or operations.

Stored Procedures: Complex, multi-step magical rituals that are stored and can be reused with different parameters to perform common tasks. For example, there might be a stored procedure for locating a person, which could be reused for different contracts.</Synopsis>

            <Text>The more you B.S. when you are writing a book, the worse the book is.  People have a real tendency with fantasy and thrillers to just make stuff up.  That almost never goes well.  When you research you get a better result and build confidence in what you are writing.  
With Maximum Ride James did research with biotech people.  Those conversations helped with seeing the possibilities for the story.  Build your credibility.  Different writers have different approaches to how they use research.  Male readers in particular are narrow in what they like and they really want realism, authentic detail.  You can’t tell them enough about how a car works and things like that and if you get it wrong you lose those readers who know about what you are talking about.
Whether it’s a kidnapping or a bee-sting, research.  Don’t write about the Subway unless you are going on the Subway first.  Know your locations.  If we go somewhere and somebody asks us about that place we will remember a few details.  Don’t write about a city without visiting it.  If you are writing a crime scene that takes place in a certain kind of apartment, visit a building that is similar.  
Conduct interviews.  Try to find out a little about the person before the interview.  Pretty much anything you want to write about is on the internet - but if you are interviewing a verbal person it can be very beneficial.  A non-verbal person not so much.  “Do you like being a police officer?  Yes.” Is not helpful.  These are essay questions not short answer.  Research and interviews are actually pretty easy to do - people want to talk to authors.  
Know your vocations - if your characters have jobs you need to learn how those jobs are done.  Ideally shadow someone.  At the same time, don’t be a know-it-all.  Sometimes it feels like authors are dropping their research on you.  In fiction, it is not good to write in omniscient third person.  Limited third person (only things the character knows about) is easier.  And as such, unless your character knows a lot about say architecture - then details from your research about architecture that a normal person would not know - should not be in your book.
Research has never been easier.  You can easily get at things that used to be really hard to get at.  So you have no excuse to avoid researching.

            <Synopsis>Inter-Tower Politics: Given their unique abilities and roles, there could be rivalries and disputes among the towers. For instance, the Tower of Time and the Tower of Scrying could have a longstanding disagreement over whether it's ethical to foresee and potentially change future outcomes. The Tower of Illusion and the Tower of Transformation might clash over the legitimacy of their craft - illusion wizards seeing transformation as "destructive", and transformation wizards regarding illusions as "deception".

Intra-Tower Politics: Within each tower, there could be power struggles for the position of the 'High Wizard' or tower head. Younger wizards might feel their ideas and methods are overlooked in favor of old traditions. Some wizards could be secretly plotting against others to gain more influence or power.

Wizards vs. Humans: Regular humans might harbor resentment towards wizards for having such extraordinary powers and influence. They might perceive wizards as aloof and disconnected from the struggles of common folk. On the other hand, wizards might view humans as short-sighted or limited in understanding the broader implications of magic and the balance it maintains.

Kingdom Politics: The rulers of different kingdoms might try to win favor from certain towers to use their powers for personal or political gains. There could be alliances and conflicts between kingdoms based on their affiliations with different towers.

The Wizard Council: This council, composed of representatives from each tower, could be the central governing body. However, it might be riddled with politics as each tower tries to push its agenda, causing gridlocks and conflicts. Some towers might feel underrepresented or marginalized.

The Hidden Faction: A group of rogue wizards might disagree with the towers' structure and control over magic. They could be building a secret movement to disrupt the current order and establish a new system where magic is accessible to all, not just the gifted ones.</Synopsis>

            <Text>For the last 5 years, Neil has been teaching at Bard College as a professor of the arts.  And each year he can teach about 25 students.  He loves teaching students to write - but the reach is rather small.  The joy of masterclass is saying this to many more people.  
The goal of this class is to teach how to find the writers toolshed and what tools are available to writers.  It also will show you where the pitfalls are - and walk you through them safely so you come out with a better idea how to write than you did when you started.
You will learn that stories are important, what stories are, and how to make stories that matter. You will get tips and exercises and a little push forward that you might not have had otherwise.</Text>

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle ebook.

How To Use This Template
	•	Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
	⁃	Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
	•	Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)
	•	Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
	•	Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
	⁃	You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
	⁃	To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
	⁃	Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit cmd-N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
	⁃	You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
	1.	Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
	2.	If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
	3.	Click on the chevron next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view. (Note that only folders with content show chevrons.)
	•	A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.

Compiling
	•	Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.
	•	Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference panel and have it open alongside the Compile panel if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.

	•	To compile to standard manuscript format:
	◦	Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use information from Contacts).
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
	◦	Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you chosen).
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

	•	To compile to paperback PDF format:
	◦	Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
	◦	Select “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81”)” from the list of formats on the left.
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it if it. (This has already been set up for you.)
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

	•	To compile to ebook format:
	◦	Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/EBook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
	◦	Import a cover image (preferably in JPG or PNG format).
	⁃	You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “EBook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
	⁃	Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels, based on Amazon’s recommended size and proportions for a Kindle cover at the time this template was created.
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
	⁃	To create an ePub file, choose the “ePub 3” format.
	⁃	To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle KF8/Mobi” format.
	⁃	“ePub 2” and “Kindle Mobi” are older versions of the formats. They are mainly provided for supporting projects created in older versions of Scrivener.
	◦	Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
	◦	If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
	◦	Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
	⁃	Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
	⁃	Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
	•	Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
	•	Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
	1.	Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
	2.	Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
	3.	Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
	•	Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document:
	1.	At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.
	2.	Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
	•	Page size: The “Paperback” format is set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06” x 7.81”, which is one of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and is a popular size for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
	1.	Ctrl-click on the “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
	2.	Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The window will change size and content.
	3.	In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (6” x 9”)”).
	4.	Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
	5.	Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
	6.	In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, select “Manage Custom Sizes…” from the “Paper Size” pop-up button.
	7.	Click the “+” button to add a new custom size and give it a name.
	8.	Enter the paper width and height. (Note this is Apple’s standard Page Setup panel, and the units it displays are determined in System Preferences under “Language &amp; Region” &gt; “Advanced…”.)
	9.	Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
	10.	Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
	•	Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
	1.	To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
	2.	To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
	3.	To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
	•	Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
	1.	Rename the “Scene” document to use your chapter title and move it so that it is on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
	2.	Move the “Chapter” folder to the Trash.
	3.	Create a new text document for each chapter.
	4.	Go to Project &gt; Project Settings and select “Section Types”.
	5.	Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
	6.	Delete “Level 1 files” and “Level 2 files and deeper”.
	7.	In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “Root files” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
	•	Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
	1.	Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
	2.	Name the document “Contents”.
	3.	In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Command to select more than one document).
	4.	For a simple flat list, hit Cmd-C or use Edit &gt; Copy. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, go to Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List.
	5.	Click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Cmd-V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
	6.	If you intend to export to an older ebook format (ePub 2 or non-KF8 Mobi), select all of the text and change it to use a 12-point font.
	7.	If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
	8.	In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”. Now, when you Compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.

Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81”)” format.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
       by Forename Surname
Chapter One
     Standard manuscript format is often required for novels
so that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors
to estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages
will be required to produce a book using the page size, style
and font used by their house. This PDF file was generated
using Scrivener's Compile feature and was created using the
"Novel" project template.
     Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate
title page. The author's name, address, telephone number and
e-mail address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the
title page, single-spaced. The title of the story should
appear in all-caps about half-way down the page. The author's
name follows the title on the by-line as the author wants it
to appear when published. A real name or pseudonym may be used
and may include initials, actual given name or professional
Surname / TITLE / 1
designation.
     All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with
a ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about
five spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional
blank line. (It used to be traditional to separate each
sentence with two spaces, but in these days of word processors
this is now less common.) A 12-point font such as Courier,
Times New Roman or Arial should be used throughout. In
Scrivener, however, you can write using any font and
formatting you choose--the options in Compile can be used to
change the formatting in the compiled document. In the "Novel"
project template, the Compile settings will deal with changing
the font and formatting to those required for standard
manuscript format.
     Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header
comprising the author's real surname, the title of the work
(or a key word from the title) in capitals, and the page
number. In Scrivener, all of this is handled for you by the
"Manuscript" Compile formats.
                               #
     Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do
not simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by
Surname / TITLE / 2
the typesetter. The "Separators" pane of Scrivener's Compile
sheet can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
Compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave
empty lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash
character during Compile) or use different documents for
different sections (and Scrivener will add the hash between
them).
     Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be
indicated by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener,
this conversion can be handled by Compile. The "Manuscript
(Courier)" Compile format will convert italics to underlines,
whereas the "Manuscript (Times)" format will not.
Surname / TITLE / 3
Chapter Two
     Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the Compile settings.
In Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
"Manuscript" compile formats.
     Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number
of words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will
happily accept a word processor word count these days. In
Scrivener, you can insert a word count of your manuscript by
using Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count (for a manuscript, you
may wish to have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in
which case select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded
To Nearest 100--this feature is used on the title page of this
manuscript, in fact).
Surname / TITLE / 4
     Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but
a tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export.
In reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only
really crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first
time novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and
agents are often less picky about format and will point you in
the right direction before submitting your work to a
publisher.

            <Title>The Glyph Array</Title>
            <Synopsis>Aiden stepped into the dimly lit room, his heart pounding in his chest. The air was thick with anticipation and a sense of ancient power. His eyes were immediately drawn to a large, round mirror resting on an ornate wooden pedestal. The surface of the mirror shimmered slightly, like still water waiting for a ripple.

Master Elias, his mentor, stood by the pedestal, his old eyes twinkling with a strange, secretive light. "It's time, Aiden," he said, his voice echoing in the silence. He reached into the folds of his robes and pulled out an object. As he placed it on a small table next to the mirror, Aiden's breath hitched.

It was a rectangular slab of polished obsidian, about the size of a parchment, glinting softly in the subdued light. The black surface was embedded with dozens of tiny, luminous symbols, each one unique, glowing with a gentle, otherworldly light. The Glyph Array. It was more beautiful and mysterious than Aiden had ever imagined.

Aiden hesitated before stepping forward, his gaze fixed on the Array. As he neared, the symbols on the Glyph Array seemed to hum softly, welcoming him, their ethereal glow reflecting in his wide, awestruck eyes.

The myriad of symbols beckoned him - a complex language of the Astral Plane inscribed in stone. He slowly reached out and gently touched one of the glowing glyphs. It brightened under his touch, a ripple of light cascading across the obsidian surface. Simultaneously, the symbol appeared in the mirror, suspended in the reflective surface as if floating in mid-air.

Aiden felt a thrill of excitement. He could sense the immense potential of the Glyph Array. Each symbol was a key, a command that could navigate the Astral Plane, each combination of symbols forming a unique question or query. And the mirror... it was the gateway, the response point, the terminal where the Astral Plane would send back its visions.

This was scrying, he realized, an intricate dance of glyphs and mirrors, reflections and visions. His heart pounded with anticipation and a hint of fear. This was his beginning, his initiation into the world of scrying. It was time to delve deeper, to learn the syntax of this arcane language, to unravel the mysteries of the Astral Plane.

It was time to become a true Scrying wizard.</Synopsis>

            <Title>Raw Ideas</Title>
            <Text>People will always ask the stupid question “Where do I come up with my stories.”  You can write a story about anything.  Sometimes a specific scene or concept catches your eye.  The idea of “Women’s Murder Club” came from James noticing in business that women are more collaborative than men are.  He found that interesting and lacking in the world of detective fiction.  So the idea of four women coming together chatting about cases and collaborate on solving  mysteries was born.
Honeymoon started with the idea of a woman who is a bigamist.  The book opens with a couple having a beautiful day together - and then she has to go off on a business trip, goes to Boston to a brownstone, and then she walks in and says Honey I’m home.  She has two husbands.  We come to find out she kills, she is a black widow Bigamist which is even more interesting.  James himself was hooked on this story.  Then we introduce an FBI agent who finds the insurance settlements peculiar.  And he is a clever dude, but she is irresistible and he falls for her slowly in a believable way.  He knows it’s stupid beyond belief but he falls for her and begins to believe her that these are accidents.  And now we have the makings of a great story - and where is it going to go?
James was working at an ad agency after school, and there was a book about how to come up with ideas.  15 years into his time at the agency he actually read the book - and it was terrific.  The author wrote about how rare it is that a person comes up with a novel idea out of nowhere - normally people put together ideas that haven’t been put together yet - creating something original.  
But in order for that to happen you must learn about a lot of things.  If you know about movies, video games, and beer it will be very difficult to be creative because you don’t have a wide universe of stimulation.  The more worldly you are the greater your ability to be combine ideas and be creative.
If you want to make money writing, it is important to have a hook that makes people go “tell me more” or “that’s really cool.”  Books without a catchy idea need an extremely compelling character and a very good writer.  Books with catchy ideas can be more leisurely and lean on the idea more.
Writers are known for waking up in the middle of the night and writing things down - or writing things down after taking drugs.  The reality is you will remember your good ideas in the morning - so if you remember it then you can write it down.  It is smart to keep an idea folder of these ideas and others that occur to you.
The trick to writing a bestseller is the ability to have a good gut and be emotional about an idea but also step back and ask “but is it a book.”  This can’t really be taught - but you can be aware of it.  Don’t invest into things that aren’t whole story.  Don’t invest in the ghost of a book.

            <Title>The Village</Title>
            <Text>I. The Village

Aiden's peaceful life is tucked away in a serene village near the sea. The air is filled with the earthy scent of the countryside and the distant murmur of the nearby ocean, occasionally interrupted by the joyful peal of children's laughter or the rhythmic clinking of a blacksmith's hammer.
Aiden wakes to find his family hard at work in their bakery.  Aiden’s brother is stressed and working very hard.  Aiden teases him, and his mother chastises him citing the great preparation and pointing out that he could help more instead of read.  
Aiden ducks out of the house and goes down to see Ava.








PRIOR TO THE SCENE


Aiden's family is a central part of this community tapestry. His parents, warm and hardworking, run the local bakery, well-loved for their freshly baked bread and mouthwatering pastries. Every dawn, they knead and shape dough into delicious creations, their small shop filled with the aroma of yeast and oven warmth.

Aiden's older brother, Garret, is a vital part of the bakery, his dedication matching that of their parents.  With his large, capable hands, he helps knead the dough and stoke the fires. His affable nature makes him popular among the villagers. Garret is content with the simplicity of their life and is set to inherit the family bakery.

Aiden on the other hand is a voracious reader who craves a life of adventure more than the life of a baker.  He reads stories by candlelight of a stealthy hero spy.  And this is what ultimately led him to apprentice with the candlemaker.

Aiden shares a close relationship with Garret. They may have different dreams, but their bond as brothers remains strong. Garret often teases Aiden about his meticulous candle-making methods and his blossoming romance with Ava, while Aiden good-naturedly mocks Garret's constant appetite and his inability to remember the names of Ava’s herbs. Despite their banter, they hold a deep respect for each other, with Garret always standing up for Aiden's choice to apprentice at the candle shop instead of joining the family bakery.

In this way, Aiden's simple life is sketched out, laying a firm foundation for the narrative journey ahead. His connection to his family, the difference in dreams between him and his brother, and his budding romance all serve to endear him to the reader before the tranquil rhythm of his life is disrupted.</Text>

            <Text>X.  The Visit

As he moved, whispers spread like wildfire, his name uttered in hushed reverence. "Orion...he's from the Owl's Watch." Orion's gaze swept over the crowd, and for a moment, Aiden felt a peculiar chill as their eyes met. Something about his gaze felt probing, almost like he was trying to read him.

In the days that followed, Elder Orion's attention seemed oddly focused on Aiden. He was there when Aiden was at the bakery, and again at the candle maker's workshop, and once more when Aiden was with Ava near the brook. His presence felt disconcerting, even more so when their eyes met.

One day, while Aiden was alone, closing the candle shop for the day, Elder Orion approached him. "Aiden, isn't it?" he began, his voice deep and resonant.

Taken aback, Aiden nodded, "Yes, sir. Can I help you with something?"

"Perhaps," Elder Orion replied cryptically. "I've noticed you around, and I must admit, your curiosity is...interesting."</Text>

            <Title>Arcane Overflow</Title>
            <Text>The "Arcane Reset" prophecy, propagated by the Nature wizards, foretells of a day when the world's magic will reach its saturation point, causing all magical energies to suddenly dissipate in a massive reset, plunging the world into a dark age of no magic - an end to the current era.

The Nature wizards use this prophecy to justify their 'Great Preparation' scheme. They claim that to ensure the survival of magic and by extension, the functioning of society, they need to collect, control, and store all possible magical resources. These include magical artifacts, enchanted materials, and individuals with a high affinity for magic. They argue that when the "Arcane Reset" occurs, these stockpiled resources will be essential for a quick reestablishment of magical energy in the world, preventing a prolonged age of darkness and despair.

Some cynics believe this is a natural occurring cycle - Not a doomsday and that it ebbs and flows.

The Nature wizards are using the fear of the so-called "Arcane Reset" to amass an enormous amount of magical resources, ostensibly for the 'Great Preparation'. The common folk, as well as other wizards, believe that these resources are being stockpiled to swiftly rebuild the world's magic following the supposed catastrophic event.

However, the astute Aiden begins to sense inconsistencies in the Nature wizards' story. His curiosity piqued and his sense of justice inflamed, Aiden decides to investigate. Through his scrying ability and sharp wit, he discovers that the "Arcane Reset" is not a cyclical phenomenon, nor a catastrophic event. It doesn't exist at all.

The shocking truth that Aiden uncovers is that the amassed resources are not meant for rebuilding magic after a fictitious catastrophe. They are, in fact, being used by the Nature wizards to construct an immense, malevolent machine. 

The resources are being used to uncover pieces of This ancient apparatus

This revelation spins Aiden's journey in an entirely new direction. He is no longer merely revealing the falsehood of a doomsday prophecy; he is exposing a malicious plot that threatens to upset the balance of magical power and disrupt the fundamental nature of magic itself. This ups the stakes considerably, turning Aiden's journey into a race against time to stop the Nature wizards and dismantle their dangerous machine.</Text>

            <Title>Basic Plot</Title>
            <Synopsis>Considering their powers and roles, the Tower of Time could make for an intriguing antagonist. They hold the power to manipulate and control time itself, a force that could prove devastating if used recklessly or maliciously.

The Tower of Time has gained unprecedented power due to a prophecy that suggests an imminent disaster, an 'End of Days' scenario. With fear and the urgency of prevention on their side, the Tower of Time has managed to convince the Wizard Council and many kingdoms to grant them more power and resources. They're growing stronger, but their methods are becoming more tyrannical and less ethical.

However, something doesn't seem right. Some of the actions taken by the Time wizards seem more self-serving than necessary for the crisis at hand. This raises suspicions among certain individuals, including our protagonist, Aiden, from the Tower of Scrying.

As Aiden's abilities grow, he begins to unveil hidden truths and secrets through his scrying. He discovers discrepancies in the accounts provided by the Time wizards about the prophecy and the true extent of their power. Additionally, he starts uncovering evidence of foul play, like missing people and mysterious occurrences, all linked back to the Time wizards.

Unraveling this conspiracy becomes Aiden's main quest in the book, taking him and the readers on a thrilling journey through realities and magical politics. He will need to be careful, though. If the Tower of Time learns that someone is onto their plans, Aiden might become a target. He will need allies and should seek assistance from the other towers, possibly revealing similar suspicions they've had but were unable to prove without the Tower of Scrying's capabilities.

This narrative setup offers a deep well of suspense, intrigue, and the potential for exciting plot developments. It sets the stage for Aiden to mature and hone his skills, pushing the boundaries of his magical abilities to their limits to unveil the truth.</Synopsis>

            <Title>Outlines</Title>
            <Text>The most common mistake young writers make is THEY DON’T DO AN OUTLINE.  Do not just wing it.  You will do a better book in less time if you do an outline.  James does 3-6 drafts of an outline.
Everything should be in the outline.  The arcs of the characters and villains should be in the outline and the villains should be complex.  Put in as much juicy stuff as you can.  Someone who reads the outline should think the book has a ton of promise because the scenes are so rich.  
Focus on the story.  The only time you will ever truly face the blank page is when you start the outline.  And it isn’t that daunting because when you write an outline you aren’t even thinking about sentences.  You are thinking just about the story.  We all know how to tell stories - we do it all the time.  Write the story don’t write sentences.
Once you have the idea that you love - just start writing scenes down.  You don’t have to go in order - you can organize the scenes later.  But write the scenes like you are playing a movie in your head.  You won’t keep all your scenes.  But start by just writing a one to two description of each scene.  Writing possible scenes down and organizing it can take 2 weeks - and then we flesh them out a little - NOT A LOT.  We turn them into 1-2 paragraph descriptions of scenes in an organized order over the course of 3-5 drafts of the outline.  This whole process can take 1-2 months.
If there is a mystery one of the keys to the outline is pacing when you reveal aspects of the mystery.  Don’t write yourself into a corner.  Intentionally write some twists and see what that does to the story - this is MUCH better to do at the outline stage.
Edit, Edit, Edit.  Put notes to yourself while you are working on the outline.  What does this scene need to make the reader feel?  A great outline you can sell to a customer.
Try a character focused approach.  One way to break down your outline is what happens to this character across the length of the story.  Be thorough - if someone reads the outline they should say “I get this book, I feel the twists, I understand why these characters are going to work.”  Then as you write it, it hopefully gets even better.</Text>

 LESSON RECAP
▶ Examples of raw ideas
▶ Where great ideas come from
▶ Try a different approach
▶ Write your ideas down
▶ But is it a book?
   ▶ Having trouble coming up with clever book ideas? James references Arthur Koestler’s theory that coming up with a fresh idea out of nowhere is very rare. More often what we do is put together disparate ideas that nobody has put together before. We love this idea and wanted to share a few tools we’ve found to help get your creativity flowing.
▶ Inspiration Finder1 A random generator which prompts you to go out of your comfort zone and find something unusual.
▶ What-if-inator2 An idea generator for possible historical outcomes. Eg. “What if Einstein lived at the same time as Napoleon?”
▶ Create a place to store your best ideas. We love a crisp notebook, a Microsoft Word or Google Drive Document,
or a 3x5 card file. James uses a simple file folder. Having a dedicated place for your working ideas is crucial for collating and finding themes or plot lines to begin researching.

▶ Below are six raw ideas we received from students who have taken this class. Watch James critique these ideas in his Office Hours video titled:
CRITIQUE—RAW IDEAS ASSIGNMENT
SAMPLE 1 BY NANCY V.
An old man on death row for a murder he did not commit finally accepts his fate, after 40 years of appeals. Knowing he will be put to death the next day, he recounts the events of the fateful day that put him in prison as a young man.
SAMPLE 2 BY ALLEGRA H.
A young photographer seeks a fresh start in Panama. Breezy afternoons give way to a fight for her life, however, when she takes the wrong photo at the wrong time, embroiling her in a web of corruption, sex, and scandal.
SAMPLE 3 BY ERIC A.
A U.S. Army communications technician returns to Wisconsin after being dishonorably discharged. He finds work at a local paper mill to support him and his shortwave radio hobby. While listening late one night, he picks up a transmission from a former Soviet numbers station – a military espionage broadcasting tool that has not been active since the Cold War.

 Revenge is the deepest form of insanity, whether it is noticed or not. Unnamed female character; abused by her lover Dillon, now lives at her Grandma’s house. Grandma is actually dead, and the unnamed female character—mentally ill narrates her story where she relives terrorizing thoughts and memories in her mind from her basement where she murdered Dillon with scissors.
SAMPLE 5 BY ALEX M.
Divorced Park Ranger stationed at the Grand Canyon befriends and accidentally kills a writer-in-residence staying at a cabin on the north rim of the canyon. He throws the writer into the canyon to make it look like a suicide and then sets out on the road with his adolescent son for their first, and final, vacation together, as the police unravel what happened on the night of the murder.
SAMPLE 6 BY JONATHAN V.
A professor of Egyptology, Dr. Amanda Walter, discovers pristine papyrus scripts of hieratic writings from 13th-century BCE Egypt that include seven mysterious mathematical equations. With the aid of an Assistant Research Professor of Mathematical Cryptography, Prof. Neema Gowon, and later, an expert on high-energy physics, Harold Grün, the equations are shown to be solutions, or correct calculations, to the problem
of calculating “dimensionless physical constants.” The results of this discovery, which commenters dub “The Anubis Solutions,” lead to a boom of research, surreal technology, terrorism, and, ultimately, a transformation of the earth into an “oceanic chaos of smartdust.

04 PLOT
Don’t set out to write a good thriller. Set out to
write a #1 thriller. —James Patterson
TAKE IT FURTHER
▶ James explains the difference between a plot and a story by using an E.M. Forster quote. “The king died and then the queen died, is a story. The king died and then the queen died of grief is a plot.” Read more from Forester’s guide to writing, Aspects of the Novel.
 ASSIGNMENT
NOTES
▶ The best plots are simply told. Using your favorite raw idea from the lesson 03 assignment, write a plot down in 3-5 concise sentences. James explains “These are not things you write overnight...it’s really hard to come up with a good idea.” Don’t worry if you don’t finish this assignment before moving on to the next lesson. You can always come back to it.
▶ Successful plots make readers say “Tell me more!” James recommends tapping your most honest friends for their feedback on your plot ideas. Once you have your original
plot condensed, call a friend and share the pitch. Pause for a moment and see if they ask for more. If they do, you might be onto something.

05 RESEARCH
Research really helps your confidence. —James Patterson
TAKE IT FURTHER
▶ This lesson includes a follow up video critique by James on his Office Hours page here. You'll find the student assignments he's critiquing on pages 13 and 14 of this workbook.
▶ Here’s an example from James’s book Invisible that illustrates how his research on house fires helped enhance his writing:
“I reach the landing and pause again. Closing my eyes, I can see the licking flames from my dreams—’angel fingers,’ the firefighters call them—snaking across the ceiling. The boiling smoke ripples like the surface of the ocean just moments before the second story erupts in flash-over, simultaneously igniting every flammable surface and turning the cozy home into a convection oven.”1
▶ If you can’t make it to Egypt or Antarctica for your location research don’t sweat it. Here are two helpful resources for getting a lay of the land.
▼ Google Street View lets you explore world landmarks,
discover natural wonders, and step inside locations such as museums, arenas, restaurants and small businesses with 360-degree images. They’ve collected highlights from their comprehensive site.2
▼ From Casablanca in Morocco to Koreatown in Los Angeles, if you’re looking for names of local restaurants or places of interest near your location, The New York Times 36 Hours column is a great place to start.3
ASSIGNMENT
▶ James stresses the importance of finding chatty interview candidates and asking open-ended questions. Write down a few open-ended questions and try them out on friends or family. Are you getting the answers you were looking for? Are their answers surprising you?

05 RESEARCH
 ▼ James suggests you add questions during the interview
that expound on the answers to your previous questions.
Be an active listener, even if it means going off script. Begin researching your story by identifying and reaching out to two potential interviewees for character development.
▼ Looking for the perfect person to interview for your story? Tap your MasterClass peers. In the discussion section of this lesson, add your request for experts in various fields of work or with travel experience. Then search the requests yourself and see where you might be of service.
▶ Research two locations where your story will take place. Describe this place in four or five sentences.
▶ Try your hand at writing a short description of a parking garage, like James did here in his book Honeymoon.
▼ “New York may be the city that never sleeps, but at four in the
morning there are definitely parts that are barely awake. One such was the dimly lit basement of a parking garage on the Lower East Side. Buried five stories beneath the street, it was a picture of stillness. A concrete cocoon. The only noise was the numbing buzz of the fluorescent lighting overhead.”4
▶ Below are six parking garage descriptions written by
fellow MasterClass students. Try your hand at editing these descriptions. What were the best parts? What didn’t work and needs to be cut? Watch James critique these descriptions in the Office Hours video titled:
CRITIQUE—RESEARCH ASSIGNMENT SAMPLE 1 BY JONATHAN V.
Galvanized steel pipes ribbed its ceiling, between veins of frayed cable and concrete columns that crumbled under their yokes; stray clots of those veins hung, freighted with cobweb, like chandeliers. The dim cubic space was a lung with end-stage emphysema. For sixty-two years it breathed Ford and Mercedes, Mercury and Saturn, Ram and Jaguar.

Four stories of split concrete and missing exit signs. Potholes made parking impossible. Only weeds were left to patch the cracks.
SAMPLE 3 BY SHAWN W.
Sheets of rust-stained concrete provided underground refuge shelter from the city’s swelter. The blinking fluorescent lights diffused barely enough light for cars navigating the garage’s narrow avenues. Winding down to the lowest level, a beam of headlights were obscured from surveillance cameras above.

A parking garage is an open area enclosed by cement walls, where people can park their cars while they run errands. Lines painted on the ground and walls indicate parking spaces, elevators, and flow of traffic. Typically, they’re used for drug deals.

Bold colors and cold tile. Macho male’s handy tools and stacks of plastic storage containers. Empty circus cars and dusty classic motor vehicles.
SAMPLE 6 BY NANCY V.
The gigantic, underground, concrete structure was damp and dimly lit. There weren’t many cars parked and the ones that were there had seen its better days. It reeked of piss and homelessness; ironically, right under the red “no trespassing” sign, a homeless man had set up his home of cardboard boxes and dirty blankets

06+07 OUTLINE PT 1-2
Don’t think about the sentences, think about the story.
Write the story down. —James Patterson
TAKE IT FURTHER
▶ At the beginning of lesson 06 James tells us that the most common mistake writers make is not creating an outline. He guarantees that making this a routine part of your writing process will make for a better and quicker book writing experience.
▶ Review the outline for Honeymoon that James has provided for you (beginning on page 45 of this workbook). We’ll be referencing the outline for this lesson and elsewhere over the course of the class.
▶ As you begin to create your own outline here are a few things to keep an eye on:
▼ Notice the rapid fire pace in the outline for Honeymoon.
Each chapter is a scene, and each scene pushes the story
forward.
▼ Rather than focusing on snazzy sentences, James focuses
on the core of the scene which propels his reader onto the next chapter. On page 24 of the Honeymoon outline James skips the sordid details and simply identifies the key actions. “The suspense doesn’t let up. O’Hara looks around outside the cabin. Her car is gone. Then the police arrive...”
▼ In the lesson 06 video, James explains the very basic needs for every outline. He will dive deeper into developing characters, adding more suspense, and editing in subsequent lessons.

06+07 OUTLINE PT 1-2 ASSIGNMENT
▶ Create a rough outline for a novel based on the story you started researching in lesson 05. You’ll need a five to ten chapter outline to practice the skills you’ll learn during the remainder of this class.
▼ If you’re having trouble getting started, James suggests trying a character driven approach. What happens to your main character in every chapter? During the editing and rewriting process you can go in and add secondary characters, subplots, etc.
▼ Stuck on making your scene perfect? Get it the next time around. Write TBD and move on! As James does, you’ll be writing and rewriting this outline multiple times.
▶ Refine your outline using what you learned in lessons 06 + 07.
▼ In every draft, James layers on more suspense, more drama,
and more twists. When he takes it too far he’ll reign it back in, but he allows himself to be as creative as possible during the first pass.
▶ After you’ve completed your rough outline (take your time! James spends up to four months writing and editing his), share the finished product with a friend who was interested in the raw idea. Have them provide honest feedback and try to incorporate a few changes based on the review.

  LESSON RECAP
▶ Freight train through
▶ How James writes
▶ Stay focused
▶ Take a break
▶ Take it seriously
▶ Practice, practice, practice
  ▶ In this lesson, James tells us his key to warding off writer’s block is to freight train through the first draft. Focus on getting the story down. If you get stuck or feel blocked write TBD on that chapter and move on. James sometimes has TBD written on two or three chapters in a row. Don’t obsess about a single chapter or press too hard. If you’re not getting it, it’s ok to move on.
▶ We found an interesting study on listening to music while you write. If you enjoy listening to classical or other lyric-free music but find it distracting while you write, try turning it down just a touch. A study has shown that moderate to low music noise levels can increase productivity, but anything over 85 decibels can decrease your creativity.1
▶ After learning about James’s daily routine, we thought it’d be interesting to see how other artists and creatives spend
their time.
▼ The book Daily Rituals: How Artists Work by Mason Curry
outlines the habits of nearly 200 creatives.
▼ In this fascinating BrainPickings.org article 15 great writers
spell out their daily routines.2
▼ Wonder where some of your favorite writers write? This
New York Times Magazine article shares photographs and descriptions of where seven authors chose to spend their workday.3

08 WRITER’S BLOCK ASSIGNMENT
JAMES PATTERSON TEACHES WRITING 18
NOTES
 ▶ Set a timer for 30 minutes and start writing down what has happened during your day so far. When the timer goes off, take note of the things that distracted you (thoughts, noises, interruptions etc.) and research ways that you can effectively remove those distractions from your writing practice. For example, is your computer distracting you from your writing? You can try going completely analog like James, who uses a pencil and yellow legal pad to write his novels, but what about just turning off your WiFi or unplugging your Ethernet cable? Was it just the internet that was your distraction?
▶ Try the same 30 minute challenge a day later, removing the distractions you discovered the day before. Repeat the process until you’ve found your ideal writing space.

09 CREATING CHARACTERS
You want your readers to have strong feelings about
your characters. —James Patterson
TAKE IT FURTHER
▶ This lesson includes a follow up video critique by James on his Office Hours page here. You'll find the student assignments he's critiquing on page 20 of this workbook.
▶ Think about your favorite fictional characters, heroes, and villains. (Need a refresher? Here’s a list of the 100 Best Characters in Fiction since 1900 from Book Magazine)1. Make a list of your top five favorite characters and define five character traits for each. For example:
▼ Humbert Humbert (Lolita) — Distinguished, self—loathing, lustful, predatory, desperate
▼ Harry Potter (Harry Potter Series) — Orphan, modest, loyal to the end, brave, irritable
▼ Hannibal Lecter (Silence Of The Lambs) — Monstrous, brilliant forensic psychiatrist, serial killer, refined gentleman, lack of conscience
▼ Willy Wonka (Charlie And The Chocolate Factory) — Dreamer Mischievous, mad scientist, eccentric, benevolent.
▼ Jo March (Little Women) — Independent, tomboy-ish, blunt, opinionated, passionate
▶ With your list of characters and their attributes, choose your favorite trait in each (we’ve made our favorites bold). Are there any similarities between the characters? Write a few sentences explaining what it is about these traits that makes each protagonist/villain so memorable.
ASSIGNMENT
▶ James explains ‘With respect to characters, you want things that really dig deep and say a lot very very quickly, to get us interested in the person.’ With that in mind, write a list of 20 traits for a new character. Then cross out 17 traits. Do the remaining traits still make for a compelling character?

I never expected to hear anything, but there was something alluring about the void. The last stations should have died with Yeltsin – operators listening then heard monotone Russian broadcasts fading into the dull thrum of radio silence. I slipped on some headphones to try to filter out the noise. The voice surged and broke through the veil of static. It was screaming.

She shouts, “Nate, if you don’t open the door this second, I am going to strangle you, then tell Mom I strangled you,” as she pounds on the bathroom door. Nate opens the door with a smirk on his face, “Geez, someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.”

▶ Heightening real dialogue ensures you won’t bore the reader with chitchat they can hear anywhere. Here are a few tips to help you avoid ordinary dialogue:
▼ Pay attention to how people interact the next time you’re on
the subway, in a cafe, or at a restaurant. What about their
conversation was interesting? What parts bored you?
▼ The next time you watch a favorite TV show or movie, turn
on the closed-captioning and mute the volume. Read the dialogue between characters. Does it read as well as it does when you’re listening to it?
▼ Find the script of a popular film and read the dialogue without watching the movie. Does the scene resonate with you without the visual storytelling?
ASSIGNMENT
▶ Write dialogue (using no narration) between two characters using this prompt:
▼ A man comes home from work early and his wife intercepts
him in the living room. He doesn’t want to tell her that he’s just been fired; she doesn’t want him to know her lover is in the bedroom.

“Bad day at work?”

He turned towards the kitchen.
“You want to drink here? Why don’t we go out?” She said.
“No—”
“Are you okay? What happened?”
“I’m fine. It’s just office politics.”
“I can see it in your face. Why don’t we go to Twigs? Get a nice dinner,

She placed her hands on his chest, eyes looking up into his.
“I’m not in the mood to go out in public,” he said.

12 BUILDING A CHAPTER
At the end, something has you propel you into the next chapter.
—James Patterson
TAKE IT FURTHER
▶ In James Patterson novels, each chapter is a single scene. Each scene is used to progress the plot line, and to keep the reader turning pages. Here’s an example of how James ends a chapter from his novel Honeymoon:
 ▼
“The last pages of the album were filled with nothing but newspaper items. The various stories and the obituary — tinted yellow now from the passage of time. Nora had kept them all.
TOP MANHATTAN DOC DIES IN MEDICAL MIX-UP , wrote the New York Post. MD A VICTIM OF HIS OWN MEDICINE, declared the Daily News. As for the New York Times there was no hyperbole. Just a simple obituary with a matter-of-fact heading: DR. TOM HOLLIS, NOTED CARDIOLOGIST, DEAD AT 42.
Nora closed the album and lay in bed alone with her thoughts about Tom and what had happened. The beginning of everything, really: the start of her life. Nora’s thoughts then turned naturally to Connor and Jeffrey. She glanced down at her left hand, which was sporting neither ring at the moment. She knew she had a decision to make.
Instinctively, Nora began compiling a mental list. Orderly and concise. All the things she loved about being with one versus the other.
Connor vs. Jeffrey.
They were both so much fun. They made her laugh, made her feel special. And there was certainly no denying that they were wonderful in bed— or wherever else they chose to have sex. They were tall, in wonderful shape, handsome as film stars. No, actually, they were more handsome than the film stars she knew...(cont. on next page)

of this workbook) see if you can find which chapter James
originally set this action.
▶ Though not for the faint of heart, James recommends watching
the movie Seven (Se7en), written by Andrew Kevin Walker and directed by David Fincher, for examples of rich and palpable scenes.
ASSIGNMENT
▶ James recommends taking a story from your own life experience and writing it down. To get you started, use his technique for building a compelling scene by using your five senses. What do you see, hear, smell, taste and feel?
▶ In Along Came A Spider, Alex Cross narrates his own part of
the story in first person; the other characters’ stories are told in third person (this style is repeated in other Patterson books, like When the Wind Blows). Using your outline, choose a chapter to write from multiple perspectives, experimenting with both first person and third person limited.

CRITIQUE—SUSPENSE ASSIGNMENT SAMPLE 1 BY SHAWN W.
Leena Morales has never backed down from a physical challenge. At 25, she still harnessed the discipline and focus that carried her through record-breaking NCAA performances and catapulted her to this year’s track and field Olympic trials. Leena could always trust her body, even during a highly speculated absence from the sport. She could trust the training that made her body strong and lean — just like the woman boldly staring back from photographs spread across her motel’s cheap Formica table. If journalists hungry for a human-interest piece could round up long-buried photos of her birth mother, what else would they find? It was getting harder and harder to ignore her intuition. All signs mirrored what accompanied this morning’s fan mail: DO NOT COMPETE.
SAMPLE 2 BY SEAN C.
During the first eight days in October, eight different men asked Agustin eight times for his wedding ring, each pointing at the plain gold band on his finger as he walked past them on the street. Each wore a nondescript suit, a business haircut, a clean shave. On the third day, while stepping up from the crosswalk onto the curb outside his office, he noticed that the man who asked for his ring wore a silver chain over his suit jacket and tie. “I’ll take your wedding ring,” the man said. When the police arrested Agustin in his home on October 9th, they found a thin silver chain, no thicker than a pencil line, spooled over his wife’s broken body.

▶ Favorite book endings
▶ Don’t shy from ambiguity
▶ Think of alternate endings
▶ Analyze your favorite endings
▶ The secret to great endings
     ▶ Think of every possible ending for the outline you started in lesson 07. Think through all of the character arcs and all of the subplots and let your imagination run wild. James suggests making a bulleted list. Then pick the most outrageous ending that works.
▶ Using your existing outline and the ending you’ve chosen, in three or four bullet points write down clues you can give your readers about how the book will end. Add these to existing chapters if you feel that they wouldn’t spoil the surprise.

...Then came the scream. Something in the kitchen with a kettle’s shriek, something metallic. She plunged awake and found herself choking, gasping, and grabbing for her sheets to cover her from the hot, charcoal- colored smoke.
Her eyes seemed to boil, even beneath the sheet. She uncovered her
eyes to search for an exit, but the boil intensified and the room was all billowing darkness. She could choose only to move away—not left, not right, not straight, but simply away.
Emmy felt her own movements as though they existed elsewhere, in some silent distance. The choking wasn’t hers. The hands that searched the now alien surfaces of her room weren’t hers. Nothing was hers. Only once, when her fingers tapped, with a thin ping, cool pane glass, was panic present. For the first one-tenth of a second of that ping, her nerves had relaxed—here was our window exit. In the next tenth of a second,
it was panic that she might lock up, like a frightened doe, in her luckiest moment.
Her fist, wound in sheet, hit the glass. A shattering pain shot from Emmy’s knuckles through to her forearm, but there was no shattering
of glass. A second shock of pain, and for the second time, the window, somewhere in the darkness, wouldn’t break. Emmy punched the window again and again. One of the countless punches broke the wrist of her right hand. Her dominant hand.
Gasping brought little relief; and soon, it brought no relief. There was
no air, only smoke. Emmy felt the sheet around her face heating up. She caught herself from pulling the sheet away and sucking in the false air beyond it. She screamed.
This scream electrified her. The flow of moments parted and in that timeless opening, Emmy dreamt. Those infra-red faces returned, invisibly dancing a tranquil minuet of shock. They danced, Emmy thought, on invisible feet. Feet that kick.
With all the swimming lightness of her fading strength, Emmy kicked. The sound of shattering glass flooded her ears and her heart, like her lungs, took a small breath. She wriggled through the jaws of the broken pane. She could feel her skin opening up in long slices. She could feel the sting of fired air and wintry bay wind meet in her wounds. She could...

HONEYMOON
BY JAMES PATTERSON HOWARD ROUGHAN
 HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 1

PART ONE
One
Interior decorator, Nora Sinclair, never met an open space she couldn’t make beautiful. Including her empty suitcase. As she packs it to perfection with neatly folded clothes she hears a playful voice over her shoulder telling her not to go. It’s Gordon Brown, her former client. And current lover. He’s sexy, cocky, and a very successful investment banker. A boyish forty to her girlish thirty-five. “You travel too much,” he tells Nora with a sigh. “This from a man with a million frequent flier miles,” she shoots back with a smile. Nora and Gordon continue their quick banter, funny and loving. We like them. They’re good together—and not just when they’re standing up. A minute later the two engage in some terrific, earth-moving sex. It makes us feel great, horny, and envious.
Two
It also makes Gordon very hungry. So afterward, Nora cooks him a juicy burger that would do Smith &amp; Wollensky proud. As they sit together in plush robes at the kitchen table of Gordon’s Westchester estate, they gaze into each other’s eyes. Gordon says he’s never been happier, and Nora agrees. “Then what’s stopping us?” he says. “You’ve already got more clothes here than I do!” Nora laughs. “Is that your idea of a proposal?” Gordon reaches into the pocket of his robe and removes a small Tiffany box. He drops to one knee. “No,” he says. “This is my idea of a proposal.” The ring is huge. It sparkles bright. And so does Nora. “Yes, yes, yes!” she sings out. “I’ll marry you Gordon Brown!” They hug and kiss and celebrate with a bottle of Dom Perignon. “A toast to happily ever after,” says Gordon. Soon, Nora’s limo arrives. She laughs and shakes her head. “The best day of my life and I’ve got to go see a client. Can you believe that?”
   HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 2

Three
Late that afternoon, Nora arrives at a spectacular brownstone in Boston’s Back Bay. On the doorstep, she removes Gordon’s engagement ring and puts on another one. She lets herself inside, and then calls out from the foyer, “Avon Lady calling. You awake? You better be awake, Mr. Walker!” A tall, handsome man comes out of his den carrying a thick manuscript. It’s Jeffrey Walker, former client and fiancé number two. He’s in his late thirties, cerebral yet charming. A wealthy, best-selling author of historical fiction. Nora drags him back into the den and makes love to him on his favorite leather couch. The reader gets horny all over again. Nora and Jeffrey make a fantastic couple—it’s a great relationship from the look of things. Après sex, Nora cooks Jeffrey a big juicy burger in her bra and panties. They talk wedding dates.
Four
That night, Nora lies in bed waiting for Jeffrey to fall asleep beside her. Finally, she hears that little whistling sound he makes. He’s officially out. And up gets Nora. She tip toes down the hall to his study and sits down behind his desk. Under the dim light of a lamp she turns on his computer. Like a pro, she begins typing. Numbers and letters. Quickly and quietly. Just as she seems to find what she’s looking for . . . Click! The room lights up. Jeffrey stands at the doorway in his boxers. “Nora, it’s 2 A.M., what are you doing?” She doesn’t flinch. “I’m sorry, honey. I couldn’t sleep so I thought I’d check my e-mails.” He shakes his head and smiles. “You never stop working, do you? You’re worse than me. Now come back to bed.” Nora says she’ll be right there. As Jeffrey leaves she closes the file she was looking at. “First Bank of the Bahamas,” reads the heading. What’s Nora up to?
   HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 3

Five
The next day, Nora arrives home to Manhattan and her huge penthouse loft in SoHo. Its ultra-modern design couldn’t be more different than Gordon’s estate in Westchester or Jeffrey’s brownstone in Boston. It’s filled with the things she loves and collects—without concern for the needs of anyone else. Nora opens a bottle of pinot grigio and pours herself a glass. She unpacks her suitcase, making a neat pile for the dry cleaner. So meticulous. Then she takes care of some Man Maintenance. She places calls to Gordon and Jeffrey, saying just the right things to both of them.
Six
After her second glass of wine, Nora draws a bath. She slips into the soft, bead- laced water and rests her head back. Her eyes close. It’s absolute bliss. But then her eyes snap open. There’s shouting coming from the living room. Nora gets up and walks quietly down the hall, peering around the corner. There, a man and a woman are engaged in a heated argument. “You can’t have her!” screams the woman. “Over my dead body will you come back here after all these years and take her away!” The man begins to laugh. “Over your dead body, huh? That I could live with.” The woman, more irate now, storms over to a closet and removes a painted blue box high on the shelf. She flips it open and takes out a gun, her hands trembling. Then Nora watches in horror as her mother pumps three bullets into her father’s chest. In the sudden quiet of the apartment, Nora begins to cry. Her mother turns and sees her. “Go back to bed, honey,” she calmly tells her little girl. “It’s all just a bad dream.”
Seven
The phone ringing jolts Nora awake from her bath. Teary-eyed and a little dazed, she answers “Hello?” on the nearby portable. It’s her best friend, Alison, confirming dinner that night with the girls. An hour later she meets up with them at Pico in TriBeCa. They eat, they drink, they laugh, they gossip. Nora’s at ease now and it’s clear that she loves her independence. What’s amazing is how her
 HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 4

friends, who think they know Nora so well, hardly know her at all. And that’s just how Nora wants it. She’s always strategically forthcoming about her life— revealing little in a way that sounds like she’s revealing a lot.
Eight
After dinner, Nora returns to her loft. She’s buzzed but still in control. Always. She gets into bed with a scrapbook and flips through some newspaper clippings. A couple of stories and an obituary for a previous lover, Dr. Richard Hollis. “Top Doc Dies in Medicine Mix-Up,” declared the Post. Nora closes the scrapbook as her thoughts turn to the new men in her life. Gordon and Jeffrey. She compiles a quick mental list of how much she enjoys being with them both . . . equally.
The laughs, the sex, the very large lifestyles. It’s such a tough decision. But with a nod of the head Nora makes up her mind. She knows exactly which one she’s going to kill first.
Nine
The next day, Nora goes shopping for a client at ABC Carpet &amp; Home. She may be an interior decorator with ulterior motives, but she sure does know her trade. Nora is clearly blessed with good taste and an eye for quality.
Ten
On a Friday at dusk, a Lincoln Town Car pulls into Gordon’s Belgium block driveway. The hired driver steps out to open the door for Nora but it’s Gordon who gets there first. He’s that anxious to see her. And by the way Nora jumps into his arms and straddles him with her legs, the feeling would appear to be mutual. As the driver shakes his head and grabs Nora’s luggage from the trunk, the two lovebirds are all over each other. “You’re insatiable,” Gordon says. “And aren’t you the lucky one,” retorts Nora.
   HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 5

Eleven
She didn’t think she’d be quite so nervous. But it’s been a while since Nora’s done this. Mostly to ease her own tension, she lets Gordon take her to the bedroom and they have sex. Then she cooks him an omelet. She’s really having butterflies. Before he even finishes his eggs, Gordon tells her that he’s feeling sick, really sick. Nora has to help him to the bathroom. She makes him drink a fizzy concoction. Within seconds, Gordon violently convulses and dies right there in the bathroom.
Twelve
Nora leaves Gordon on the bathroom floor, goes to the kitchen, and fixes herself a stiff drink. She carefully washes out the glass that held the fizzy concoction with the poison she used to murder Gordon. Then it’s showtime. Nora calls 911 and delivers a panicked, jumbled, and thoroughly convincing cry for help. When an ambulance arrives she is equally as compelling in person. No doubt about it. Nora is a great little actress.
Thirteen
As Gordon is pronounced dead on the scene, police arrive to file a report. Nora gives a command performance of grief and disbelief. “He had just proposed to me!” she sobs. The police listen with sympathetic ears, take their requisite notes, and have a look around. It’s clear they don’t suspect a thing, especially when Nora overhears a bit of their conversation. “Shit out of luck,” says one of the cops. “The chick was thisclose to grabbing the brass ring.” The second cop nods and stifles a smirk. “Yeah, and then the brass ring drops dead.”
Fourteen
The EMS guys, the police, the morgue wagon—they’ve all left. Nora is finally alone in Gordon’s house. Calmly, she walks to his study and boots up his computer. In no time she’s logged on to a private numbered account at the “International Bank of Zurich.” She types in Gordon’s name and his seven digit
 HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 6

security code. “Desired transaction?” the screen asks. Nora clicks on the second box listed: TRANSFER. With a few more codes and access numbers, millions of Gordon’s untaxed and untraceable money is deposited in her own offshore account. Nora makes her second killing of the day.
Fifteen
The following afternoon, Nora is called by one of the cops who came to the house. He’s heard from the County Coroner’s office where an autopsy has been performed on Gordon. Congestive heart failure at age forty. What a tragedy.
Sixteen
Gordon’s sister flies in from Virginia for the funeral. Other than her, he had no other surviving family. The estate is settled. Naturally, Gordon’s last will and testament pre-dated Nora. Most of his assets go to the sister with the rest earmarked for charities. Poor Nora. She gets nothing. The sister, who at first feared Nora would contest, is now apologetic. She tells Nora to use the house a while. She’s in no rush to sell it. “And keep the furnishings. After all, that’s what brought you and Gordon together in the first place.”
Seventeen
Nora stands on the front steps of Gordon’s home and watches as his sister leaves for her return trip to Virginia. The woman is clueless to Nora’s game. As is everyone else. “No red flags. Only a checkered one,” thinks Nora, her heart racing with excitement. She’s one smart girl. And now an even richer one. “You’re my queen,” Gordon was fond of saying. Soon, in keeping with her grand plan, she’ll be living like a real one.
Eighteen
Nora turns to head back into the house but not before looking over at the hedges. She thought she heard something. Click! Click! Click! There it is again. She stares and sees nothing, though. Probably a bird, she decides. As
 HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 7

she takes the last step into the house the Nikon D1-X Digicam chirps one last time from its perch in the hedges. Yes, indeed. Nora Sinclair isn’t the only one with a grand plan.
PART TWO
Nineteen
In a small insurance agency office, Craig Reynolds sits at his desk sifting through pictures of Nora from his digicam. The place looks kind of dismal, and so does he. He finally calls his boss, Susan, on his cell phone. He usually calls her a few times a day. “I need you to be a sounding board. So how do I sound?” he asks. He’s speaking in a pretty thick New York accent. He tells her a very funny story, in which he uses a couple of different accents. “You’ll do just fine,” Susan says. “That’s why we picked you for the job. You’re an original and you have an excellent plan.” Craig chuckles at her omission. “. . . Plus, I’m no longer on probation.” “Yeah, that too,” she admits. “Seriously, thanks for the vote of confidence, Suze.” “Yeah, well, I’m still your biggest fan.” We get that feeling.
Twenty
Nora visits her mother who is now at a psychiatric facility in upstate New York. Two nurses sitting at their station watch her arrive. The younger one, new to the ward, inquires about the mother’s background. The older nurse, a long time staffer named Ms. Emily Barrows, fills her in. She explains that after the mother served her first few years in jail for killing her husband, she slowly but surely began to lose her grip on reality. Nearly thirty years later and she barely knows her own name. “That’s nice that the daughter comes to visit, though,” says the younger nurse. “I suppose,” replies Emily Barrows.
  HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 8

Twenty-one
“Hello, mother,” says Nora. “It’s your daughter.” But unfortunately it could be the Tooth Fairy for all this poor woman knows. Still, Nora is very sweet with her. She brushes her hair and holds her hand. This side of Nora is so incongruous with her murderous ways and yet, given her childhood trauma, the reader begins to understand the paradox.
Twenty-two
Craig Reynolds is cleaning the lens of his Nikon digicam for the third time in twenty minutes. Revved up and impatient, he’s sitting in a BMW sedan parked on the street in front of Gordon Brown’s Westchester estate. Craig never did like stakeouts. Not back in the day when he was a rogue cop, and certainly not now in his new career. Finally, Nora arrives in a red convertible. Gordon’s Mercedes. He’s only been dead for two weeks but, hey, the car drives great. As Nora starts to unload some groceries, Craig quickly crosses the big front lawn and introduces himself. He manages the local field office for Centennial One Life Insurance. He says they spoke once on the phone, but she might not remember. She doesn’t. “What’s this about?” Nora asks him. “It’s about the 1.9 million dollar insurance policy on Mr. Brown.” Nora looks at him blankly. “You mean you don’t know about it?” asks Craig. She shakes her head. “Then you also don’t know this. You’re listed as the sole beneficiary, Ms. Sinclair.”
Twenty-three
Nora invites Craig Reynolds inside. She’s noticed that he’s very intense, and if he wasn’t such a bad dresser, and didn’t have such a heavy New York accent, he’d be kind of attractive. His car is pretty nice too. “I don’t understand,” she says. “Gordon had plenty of money and no wife or kids. He’d never bother with life insurance.” Craig explains that it was a policy provided by Gordon’s firm—a perk, and a fairly new one at that. “That probably explains why Mr. Brown put you down as the beneficiary.” Nora thinks for a moment. This certainly wasn’t part of her plan but for an added windfall of 1.9 million, she’s not about to
 HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 9

complain. “So when will the payout be made?” she asks. “Well, you see, that’s why I’m here, Ms. Sinclair. There’s a little bit of a problem.”
Twenty-four
Nora doesn’t like what she hears but doesn’t show it. She begins to put away her groceries and Craig even helps out. He explains that while his field office services the policy (and was chosen on the basis of proximity to the client) it’s the home office in Chicago that calls the shots. Says Craig, “The thing is, they’ve decided to investigate the claim because of Mr. Brown’s relatively young age.” He tells Nora that a man by the name of John O’Hara will probably be assigned to the investigation. “Supposedly, he’s a hardass, but I’ll see what I can do to speed things along for you.” Nora is thankful. Craig Reynolds is bending over to be nice.
Twenty-five
The next morning, Nora is loading her suitcase into her newly adopted convertible. The color red suits her, she decides. As she closes the trunk she notices that guy from the insurance agency watching from his car. Rollins? No, Reynolds, she remembers. Nora walks over to him and Craig disarms her like a bomb squad expert—he’s so incredibly nice. And he is cute. He says he has good news. John O’Hara, the man from the home office in Chicago, has definitely been put on the case but he said that there should be a resolution soon. Nora looks at Craig. “Is that it?” She’s a little confused about why this guy came out to the house again. “I just thought you’d want to know,” he says. He nods toward the convertible. “Taking a trip?” Nora tells him about having a client down in Florida and takes off.
 HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 10

Twenty-six
Craig returns to his car and calls in to his boss, Susan. He tells her that he’s met the enemy and she’s an incredible piece of work. Susan says, “If anybody can bring her down, it’s you.” That is definitely Craig’s plan.
Twenty-seven
Nora’s not more than two blocks away from having said good-bye to Craig Reynolds when she turns around. She’s the suspicious type and knows that everything in this world is not always as it seems. Take her, for instance. Nora heads back hoping to catch Craig leaving. There’s something not quite right about him. When she sees his car up ahead, still in front of Gordon’s home, she pulls over. While waiting to follow him, she reaches for her cell phone and calls Jeffrey in Boston. Bogged down by another demanding client, she tells him. She’ll have to delay her arrival up there until tomorrow. Jeffrey is disappointed. He shouldn’t be. He gets to live to see another day.
Twenty-eight
This guy could really use some excitement in his life, thinks Nora. She tails Craig back to his office and then to a two-bit diner soon thereafter where he has lunch. Later, he drops some laundry off at the cleaners, returns a movie rental, and gets his oil changed on his car. That night, it’s dinner in another two-bit diner and a bad foreign film at the art movie theater in Pleasantville. Craig’s last stop is his condo in a nondescript complex. Nora watches him go inside and, after another minute, drives off. Satisfied.
Twenty-nine
Craig grabs a Coors Light from his fridge, sits down on his slip-covered couch, and picks up the phone. He dials. “What’d I tell you, Boss,” he says to Susan the second she answers. “Nora followed me all day long.” Craig stands and
 HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 11

goes to the window and takes a furtive peek out front. “Yeah, she’s gone now,” he says, taking another big swig from his beer. “Starting tomorrow it’s my turn!”
Thirty
The next day, Nora heads off to Boston. As usual, she travels first class. It’s a great way to meet interesting, wealthy men, and this trip would seem to be the perfect example. Sitting in the window seat next to her is a man named Blake Donaldson. Tan and wearing a collarless shirt, he tells Nora about his software company and how he took it public last year. “How exciting!” she tells him. Then she gets down to business. She talks innocently about reading an article that said a lot of savvy people were hiding money in offshore accounts. “Do people really do this?” she asks, with a convincing naïveté. “Guilty as charged,” whispers back Blake. Ten minutes later, she indoctrinates him into the Mile High Club. Blake Donaldson is officially next in line for Nora.
Thirty-one
Meanwhile . . . Craig Reynolds is following her. He’s sitting back where the wine comes in tiny bottles with twist-off tops. Coach. He’s been careful not to be spotted by Nora, donning a pretty decent disguise. This should get interesting now. What’s in Boston?
Thirty-two
Craig wonders who the man in the collarless shirt is getting a kiss on the cheek by Nora outside the arrival gate at Logan. “The guy sure looks happy, though,” he says to himself. Twenty minutes later, Craig is in his rental car following Nora in hers. A song plays on the radio: “Head Games” by Foreigner. Suddenly, in the Callahan Tunnel, he loses her. Or did she lose him? Craig slams his fist into the dashboard several times. He pulls over and calls Susan. “Fuck me, I lost her!” he says. He hangs up, gets out on the side of the road, and paces for a moment. Then . . . POW! He punches out a side window of his rental car.
  HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 12

Thirty-three
Nora isn’t absolutely certain someone is following her, but she thinks so. Or is it just paranoia? She goes to the Back Bay apartment, where Jeffrey is working away on his latest novel. Somehow, someway, she lures him to the bedroom. They work up quite the appetite.
Thirty-four
Nora cooks omelets, which she and Jeffrey eat out on the secluded patio behind the brownstone. They talk about how hard they both work and Jeffrey suggests a long vacation in Tuscany. “We’ll rent a villa—better yet, we’ll buy a villa!” he says. “After all, life is for the living.” Oh, the irony. And oh, what a shade of green suddenly comes over him. Nora runs and gets Jeffrey a fizzy concoction. He drinks it and dies within a minute.
Thirty-five
Nora takes a moment to finish her glass of pinot grigio before stepping over Jeffrey to head inside and carefully wash out the glass that held the fizzy concoction and poison. Then it’s showtime . . . again. Nora calls 911 and when an ambulance arrives, she’s inconsolable. With this performance the EMS techies actually get tears in their eyes. Of course, Red Sox fans in Boston are rather used to crying.
Thirty-six
A couple of hours later and Nora finally has her privacy. She walks to Jeffrey’s library and turns on the computer. While she waits for it to boot up, she pulls out a drawer from his partner desk. Underneath it is where he kept his codes. After a host of keystrokes, Nora hits ‘TRANSFER’ and sits back in the chair. In a few minutes she’ll not only be able to buy a villa in Tuscany, but also a vineyard to go with it. She lets go with a devilish smile when suddenly a voice calls out from the hallway. “Is there anyone here?”
 HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 13

Thirty-seven
Shit! Nora anxiously gets up from the computer where Jeffrey’s money remains in cyber-limbo. She goes to the door and practically runs into her unexpected visitor. It’s Elaine Lippman, Jeffrey’s editor. In tears, the middle-aged woman explains that she came rushing over after a reporter with a police scanner called about Jeffrey’s death. “The front door was open and I—wait, I’m sorry, who are you?” Nora introduces herself, her voice cracking. “Oh, I’m so, so sorry,” says Elaine. “This is just awful. I didn’t mean to barge in on you at such a horrible time.” Then Elaine shows her true colors. She’s come with a blank disk to get the latest version of Jeffrey’s manuscript. “It’s what he would’ve wanted,” she says. As Elaine makes a move toward the computer, Nora acts fast. And what acting it is. “How dare you!” she screams. “Have you no fucking shame?!” With a few more expletives, a cowering Elaine Lippman is shown the door. Nora’s not about to be exposed by some crass book editor!
Thirty-eight
Jeffrey’s funeral. The guy had more siblings than Gordon, but it just means
that more people have no idea what Nora is up to. After the service, Jeffrey’s accountant, a fidgety man, approaches Nora. He asks cryptically if his deceased client ever mentioned anything about having “foreign investments.” Nora plays dumb and watches the guy squirm. He’s powerless. As a supposed upstanding, law-abiding, financial advisor he too has to pretend he has no idea that Gordon was cheating the IRS.
Thirty-nine
Nora returns to Manhattan and the life she loves. She meets with a client, goes on a wild shopping spree, and touches base with Blake Donaldson—her man in the on-deck circle. He says that he’ll be in the city the following week for a shareholder’s meeting. They set a date to get together.
 HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 14

Forty
That evening, Nora meets her best friend, Alison, for drinks at the Cub Room in SoHo. They talk about men, dating, relationships, and love. As much as Nora wouldn’t dare reveal her deadly secret, the way she discusses her feelings with Alison delivers some further insight into to what makes her tick. The reader, strange as it might seem, can’t help but relate to Nora.
Forty-one
“Hello, mother,” she says softly. “It’s your daughter.” Nora is back up at the psychiatric facility early the next morning where she updates her barely there mother on the happenings in her life. Fascinating is the way Nora makes cloaked references to Gordon and Jeffrey. “Doomed relationships” she says. As Nurse Barrows arrives with the noontime medication, Nora bids farewell to her mother with a sweet kiss on the forehead.
Forty-two
Nora returns to Gordon’s estate in Westchester later that morning. There are two messages on the answering machine. The first is from a friend who owns an antique consignment business in Greenwich. That’s where most of Gordon’s furnishings will go. The second message is from Craig Reynolds who says he’s got some bad news. “Please call me ASAP,” he tells her.
Forty-three
Nora immediately calls Craig who says they should talk in person. It’s about O’Hara. Nora offers to come by Craig’s office later in the day. He points out that it’s Sunday. He suggests the Tarrytown Diner. They agree to meet at one o’clock.
Forty-four
Craig Reynolds hangs up from Nora and calls his boss, Susan. “O’Hara!” Susan says when she hears his voice. Yep, Reynolds is O’Hara. “Tell me what’s going
  HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 15

on. Is your big plan working? Have you caught the notorious Nora, or has she gone on and killed somebody else?” O’Hara talks to Susan and he has no New York accent. He’s a very slick, very calculating. He’s playing a part himself. O’Hara is an FBI agent playing the part of Craig Reynolds, a small town insurance broker. O’Hara is one hell of an actor too.
PART THREE
Forty-five
Reynolds/O’Hara takes a leisurely drive to the diner. The “insurance man” goes over his plan for Nora. He has a good idea what she’s up to but he lacks a smoking gun. As it’s been decided that a more detailed autopsy of Gordon Brown’s body is needed, O’Hara will weave it into the sting operation on Nora. He’ll use it to get closer to her and further gain her confidence. All the better when the time comes to take her down.
Forty-six
At the diner, Craig Reynolds seems embarrassed and a little nervous, almost as if he’s suddenly on Nora’s side in the insurance investigation. This goddamn O’Hara! he says. He’s apparently contacted the FBI. Supposedly, the police have agreed to exhume Gordon Brown’s body and perform tests on it. Nora can’t believe it. Craig said he’d stop it if he could. “If I was O’Hara, I’d never do something like this.”
      HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 16

Forty-seven
Nora and O’Hara. Two people wanting to get closer to each other in the name of one thing. Suspicion. This begets Craig agreeing to go for a ride with Nora in her convertible after the diner. Interestingly, they make a nice couple together. She really guns it on the back roads. Her skirt rides a little high on her thighs. She begins to tell Craig some background about herself, perfectly blending fact and fiction. She’s kind of vulnerable suddenly, even a little sweet.
Forty-eight
Later that day, O’Hara is back on the phone with his boss, Susan. “She’s the queen of half-truths,” he says about Nora. “Not surprising given that our file on her is only half complete,” replies Susan. The problem is that they can only trace Nora back to her college days at Brown where, fittingly, she was expelled for working as a call girl. O’Hara sighs. “Prior to that, Nora Sinclair is a ghost,” he says. “If that’s even her real name,” adds Susan. She warns O’Hara to watch his step. She mentions a prior investigation, the one that put him on probation. As much as he doesn’t want to hear it, he knows he deserves it. His transition from a follow-your-instincts cop to a follow-the-rule-book FBI agent has been anything but smooth. O’Hara can ill afford any more bumps in the road.
Forty-nine
Nora is back in Manhattan where she has dinner out with her hot new prospect, Blake Donaldson. He’s handsome and he’s charming. He’s also something else. Full of shit. “I’ve got a little confession to make,” he says after two bottles of merlot. “I’m not really a software mogul. I’m actually an advertising copywriter.” Nora can’t believe it. Not that he lied, but that he was able to fool her. She’s used to being on the very top of her game. Blake begs Nora not to be upset and says he hopes she could like him for who he is—meaning, not rich. “Of course,” she says with a twinkle in her eye. A minute later Nora excuses herself to go to the bathroom . . . back at her apartment.
 HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 17

Fifty
The police arrive with shovels one night at the quaint Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Westchester. There isn’t anything quaint about Gordon Brown’s body after several weeks being underground.
Fifty-one
Nora watches the macabre scene from a distance. This is weirding her out. She’s also getting incredibly angry. While she can see Craig there with the local police, there’s no one who could be O’Hara. “Who the hell does this guy think he is?!” she wonders. And just how much more trouble does he plan on causing?
Fifty-two
Two days later, Nora gets another message from Craig. He’s got some gratifying news, he tells her. When she calls back he explains that the tests conducted on Gordon’s body were negative. They showed no foul play. “So is Centennial One Life Insurance finally going to release my money?” she asks. He says they will as soon as O’Hara okays it. Nora begins to cry. Craig says, “Let me buy you lunch.” “Will this come out of the 1.9 million?” “No, it’s on me. I’m so sorry this is happening to you. I’m really sorry, Nora.”
Fifty-three
The lunch is very nice, very cozy. They’re both playing their head games. Afterward, apropos of nothing on this planet, Craig asks her if she wants to see his place? “Is this a test, Craig? Did you want to know if I really loved Gordon?” “Did you?” “Yes, I loved him so much it hurts.” They go to Craig’s place anyway. They flirt like crazy for a while. It’s super-suspenseful. Then they go to bed. Nobody is any more shocked than O’Hara. Afterward, he’s in his bathroom looking at himself in the mirror. “Well? Johnny? Now who are you, pal?”
 HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 18

Fifty-four
The seduction/cat &amp; mouse game has really begun. But who’s seducing whom? Who’s the cat? Who’s the mouse? O’Hara talks with his boss again. They’re quite the humorous pair, actually. Susan is the best voice-over-only character in a decade. He tells her what’s going on, but manages to leave out what happened with Nora at his apartment. Still, she warns him again, “Careful, O’Hara. Careful.”
Fifty-five
It’s all part of the job right? And he’s the best. That night he takes Nora to the art movie theater in Briarcliff Manor. It’s what Craig Reynolds would do, right? Then they go to her place—otherwise known as Gordon’s estate—where they have their best sex yet. There’s something about Nora that’s irresistible. He’s sure that she likes him. She couldn’t be faking it, could she? Careful, O’Hara. Careful.
Fifty-six
The next morning, Nora coaxes Craig to stay home from work. They’re getting kind of cute together. The two of them take the train to Manhattan. Nora gets him to try on and buy new clothes at the Polo store. He looks terrific. It’s as if she’s trying to spruce up Craig’s image. Once a decorator, always a decorator. Then Nora takes him back to her loft. In bed, she attempts to get him to talk without the New York accent. Craig tries, but says it’s too hard and that he’s not much of an actor.
Fifty-seven
O’Hara returns to Westchester the following day and checks in at the Centennial One Life Insurance Agency. The place is just a front, staffed by FBI personnel. “Good morning, Molly Penny,” he says, joking with his female assistant. O’Hara
   HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 19

then calls Susan to give her an update. All the while, he’s looking at pictures of Nora from his digicam.
Fifty-eight
Nora, who has remained in Manhattan, meets up for dinner with her girlfriends. Later in the evening, when it’s just her and Alison, she excitedly explains that she’s met someone. Nora talks all about Craig and the rush of adrenaline he gives her. Who knew she could get that from a guy in insurance? “There’s like this raw energy with him just beneath the surface,” she says. “It’s intoxicating!”
Fifty-nine
Nora calls Craig late that night. They have incredible phone sex. Those 970 numbers have nothing on these two.
Sixty
The next day, Nora wants the real thing. She returns to Westchester and calls Craig for an afternoon rendezvous. But he tells her that he’s already got plans. “What plans?” she wants to know. He vamps. “Actually, I’ve got a seminar to go to. I’d blow it off but I’m one of the featured speakers.”
Sixty-one
Nora doesn’t know if she should believe him. She gets in her convertible and stakes out Craig’s apartment. When he leaves in his car she follows, tailing him all the way to New Canaan, Connecticut. A ranch house on a ranch house street. She watches as the automatic garage door opens and Craig pulls in. Clearly, his house. “Some seminar!” she says, fuming. But she ain’t seen nothing yet. Nora’s mind is about to be completely blown. As she pulls closer to the mailbox she spies the nearly faded name on it. “O’Hara.”
  HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 20

Sixty-two
Before Nora can decide what to do with this infuriating new development, the front door of the ranch house begins to open. With no cover for her easily recognized red convertible, she peels off. She drives back to Westchester and, in a fit of rage, breaks a few things in Gordon’s house. She’s besieged by so many unanswered questions. Why the set-up by O’Hara? Is there really an insurance policy? And what’s with the sex—is that part of his plan? Nora decides it’s time to get some answers.
Sixty-three
First, a little more domestic reconnaissance. The next morning, Mrs. O’Hara answers the door of the ranch house. There stands Nora. She’s checking out the scene. Mrs. O’Hara is attractive enough and there are two little kids frolicking about in the living room. Nora says she’s there to invite Mrs. O’Hara to join the Junior League. Mrs. O’Hara listens politely for a while then finally she says, “No offense, but fuck the Junior League.” Nora walks away smiling. No offense taken. She mutters to herself, “John O’Hara—the cheating family man with the potty-mouthed wife.”
Sixty-four
Next up, Nora pays a visit to the Centennial One Life Insurance agency in Westchester. It looks real enough and the “receptionist” couldn’t be more helpful. Until, that is, Nora asks for a copy of Gordon’s insurance policy. The receptionist stammers a bit and says she’ll take a look through the file in the back. When she returns she says it must be at the home office. “Oh, that’s right,” says Nora. “Mr. Reynolds told me it was up in Hartford.” The receptionist nods. “Then that’s where it must be.” Of course, as Nora well remembers, Craig had originally said the home office was in Chicago.
  HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 21

Sixty-five
Nurse Barrows looks up at Nora as she signs in. “Is everything all right?” the woman asks. Nora nods her head and lies. “Yes, thank you, everything’s fine.” It’s morning and Nora, very much on edge, visits her mother. She continues her cloaked references but she cannot mask her emotions regarding O’Hara and his “betrayal.” Nora is clearly besides herself.
PART FOUR
Sixty-six
Nora is back in Manhattan and back in her loft. She goes to her closet and takes a painted blue box down from her top shelf. Staring at it, she hears echoes of her father laughing at her mother that fateful night. It was so many years ago and yet it feels like yesterday. With her hands trembling, Nora slowly opens the lid of the box.
Sixty-seven
It’s the next night. Nora is sitting in her convertible outside O’Hara’s apartment in Westchester. She watches for a little while, then dials him on her cell phone. She invites him to her cabin on Candlewood Lake. He says no, he can’t come as he’s up to his neck in work. “Liar,” she says. “I’m watching you.” He looks out the window and sees her car parked. “Come on, Craig, you know you want to be with me. And I want to be with you.”
Sixty-eight
The heat is on and the top down. Nora is flying. Music is blasting. O’Hara is wondering what he’s doing in this woman’s car, and why is it that part of him wants to be here? He has the weirdest thought he can imagine. He wants to
   HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 22

catch Nora really bad, but at the same time, he kind of wants her to get away. So does the reader. Now where do you go with that?
Sixty-nine
The cabin is right on the lake and it’s romantic, moonlit, the whole nine yards. Perfect. When they arrive, Nora is all over Craig. Then she pulls away from him. “I’m going to cook us dinner first.”
Seventy
She puts on some romantic music, and she prepares omelets. She’s a good, very enthusiastic cook, and she really is great with men—the best.
Seventy-one
While they eat, O’Hara asks Nora a few trick questions about the lies he knows she’s told him, but that she doesn’t know he knows. He plays it straight. So does she. Just about everything they say is ironic. And often funny. They’re playing a really dangerous game here. Then Nora asks the most unexpected question of all. “Do you love me? Because I love you.”
Seventy-two
Suddenly, out of nowhere, O’Hara is feeling deathly ill. This is the worst he’s ever felt in his life. He rushes to the bathroom as Nora prepares her fizzy drink. Love hurts. And now it’s about to kill.
Seventy-three
Nora tries to give him the drink but at the last moment he pushes her out of the bathroom. He shuts the door and locks it, quickly dialing 911 on his cell phone. He’s scared. He’s vomiting. His heart is racing beyond control. Nora bangs on the door. “You all right in there?” she asks. “You okay, O’Hara?”
    HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 23

Seventy-four
“That’s Agent O’Hara of the FBI,” he shouts back. The pain in his stomach is unyielding. He’s now beyond dry heaving and is coughing up blood. If he can just hold out for the police. “I know you killed Gordon Brown, Nora, and I know why. I also know about Dr. Richard Hollis in Manhattan way back when.” O’Hara reaches down to his pant leg and removes a small pistol from his shin holster. “It’s over, Nora, I know too much . . . and I’m gonna live to tell about it.” Nora bristles. “That’s what you think, O’Hara!”
Seventy-five
The first shot just barely misses him. But the second shot finds flesh. As splinters fly from the door, blood gushes from O’Hara’s shoulder. He screams out in agony. “That’s my insurance policy!” screams Nora with a tight grip on her gun—yes, the same gun her mother used to kill her father. O’Hara hits the floor and fires three shots back at her through the door. Then . . . silence.
Seventy-six
Anxious seconds pass. O’Hara quietly, oh-so carefully, unlocks the bathroom door. He’s sweating bullets. Did the ones he fired hit their mark? Or are there more waiting for him outside the bathroom? Only one way to find out. Three- two-one, he counts down to himself before crashing through the door, ready to take down Nora once and for all. But she’s not there! Where the hell is she? She’s even scary when she isn’t there.
Seventy-seven
The suspense doesn’t let up. O’Hara looks around outside the cabin. Her car is gone. Then the police arrive. O’Hara’s cell phone rings. “You fucked with the wrong girl, O’Hara! Now I’m going to hurt you where you live . . . for real. Can you say New Canaan?”
   HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 24

Seventy-eight
The police rush O’Hara to his house in New Canaan. The lights are on. He barrels in to a rush of relief. Everyone’s okay. The phone rings and O’Hara hits the speakerphone. She doesn’t wait for a hello. “Good, I’ve got an audience,” says Nora. “I just wanted to let you know, Mrs. O’Hara, that I’ve been fucking your husband!” Click! O’Hara looks at his wife. Actually, his ex-wife for about two years now. “And you wonder why we got a divorce?!” she barks at him.
Seventy-nine
O’Hara is sitting in his office—his real one—at Manhattan’s Federal Plaza.
He’s stewing. It’s been two weeks since Nora nearly killed him. His desire to catch her is matched only by his frustration in not being able to so far. All the planning and plotting, and nothing to show for it. Except, of course, a nice new 22 caliber scar on his shoulder. That, and an FBI disciplinary review board hearing the following week. Hello, suspension. Just then his cell phone rings. “I’ve missed you,” she says. It’s Nora! Calling from not-even-God-knows-where. “You’ll be seeing me soon enough,” says O’Hara. “I’ll find you, Nora, trust me.” She laughs. “You’re so cute when you’re angry.” Click! O’Hara stands up from his desk and whips his cell phone against the wall. It shatters into pieces.
Eighty
The next day, O’Hara is sitting at his desk reading the directions for his new cell phone. He can’t get his ringer to stop playing Beethoven and it’s driving him crazy. His assistant, “Molly Penny” from the bogus Westchester office of Centennial One Life Insurance, pokes her head in. “Susan wants to see you,” she tells him.
 HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 25

Eighty-one
O’Hara steels himself, then goes to see his boss. He’s been on a strict diet of humble pie and assumes it’s time for another slice. When he enters her office she’s staring out the window with her back to him. Lots of tension here. She turns around. O’Hara’s boss, Susan, is also his ex-wife from New Canaan. “There’s someone I want you to meet,” she tells him.
Eighty-two
Sitting in an FBI conference room, Nurse Emily Barrows is a little nervous. After all, she had no business using a call box to listen in on a patient’s conversation. Not that Nora’s mother was doing much of the talking. Barrows explains that just before the news broke about the interior decorator who was leaving a trail of dead rich guys, Nora paid one last visit to her mother. What was said proves to be the break O’Hara and Susan are looking for.
Eighty-three
Nora is with a man named Jordan Christopher at a beautiful inn on the beach in Barbados. It’s absolute paradise. As they lounge in their spectacular suite, there’s a knock at the door. Room service is right on time. A silver serving table is wheeled into the suite—champagne and caviar. The waiters are O’Hara and Susan. O’Hara says, “Hello Nora.” Susan snaps, “Don’t you talk to her, O’Hara! Don’t you say another word.” Then she looks Nora dead in the eye. “You’re busted, you bitch.” Then she looks at Jordan Christopher. “And you . . . you’re the luckiest man alive.”
Eighty-four
Come sunset that same day, Susan is relaxing on a beach chair at the inn in Barbados. Nora has been taken away by the authorities. O’Hara returns with two umbrella drinks saying that the kids are fine back home. As the two of them talk and laugh it’s clear that reconciliation is in the air. O’Hara turns to Susan.
    HONEYMOON-JAMES PATTERSON-July 7, 2002 Page 26

“This would be a great place for a second honeymoon, don’t you think?” She reaches over and takes his hand. “We’ll see, O’Hara. We’ll see.”
The End.

            <Title>How To Start</Title>
            <Synopsis>Starting a large project like this can be daunting, but remember that every story, no matter how complex, is just a series of steps taken one at a time. Here's a simple process you can follow to go from your world-building and plot outline to actual chapters:

1. Break down your story into Acts:
The classic three-act structure works well for many stories, where Act 1 is the setup, Act 2 is the confrontation, and Act 3 is the resolution. For example:

Act 1: Aiden's life in his village, the visit from the emissaries, his discovery of his gift, and his journey to the Tower of Scrying.
Act 2: Aiden's training at the tower, learning about scrying and the Astral Plane, discovering the intrigue between the Tower of Time and Tower of Illusion.
Act 3: Aiden's attempts to expose the conspiracy, the climax of the conflict, and the resolution of the story.
2. Divide each Act into scenes or sequences:
Scenes are the building blocks of your story. Identify key events or scenes in each act. For instance, in Act 1, a key scene could be the emissaries' visit to Aiden's village and his test.

3. Develop a Chapter Outline:
Based on these scenes, develop an outline for your chapters. One or more scenes could form a chapter, depending on the pace and flow you want. Remember, chapters are flexible and can be rearranged as you develop your story.

4. Write Chapter Summaries:
Write a brief summary for each chapter based on the scenes it includes. This gives you a clear road map to follow as you write, and you can always refer back to it.

5. Start Writing:
Choose a chapter that you feel particularly drawn to — it doesn't have to be the first one — and start writing. Scrivener is a fantastic tool that allows you to write your chapters as individual sections that you can easily move around.

6. Review and Refine:
Once you have a draft, review it. Are the plot points clear? Are the characters' motivations understandable? Does the pacing feel right? Edit and refine your work, chapter by chapter.

Remember, writing is a process, and it's okay to make changes and revisions. The most important thing is to get started. Once you have something on the page, you can work with it and improve it. Happy writing!</Synopsis>
            <Text>Starting a large project like this can be daunting, but remember that every story, no matter how complex, is just a series of steps taken one at a time. Here's a simple process you can follow to go from your world-building and plot outline to actual chapters:

1. Break down your story into Acts:
The classic three-act structure works well for many stories, where Act 1 is the setup, Act 2 is the confrontation, and Act 3 is the resolution. For example:

Act 1: Aiden's life in his village, the visit from the emissaries, his discovery of his gift, and his journey to the Tower of Scrying.
Act 2: Aiden's training at the tower, learning about scrying and the Astral Plane, discovering the intrigue between the Tower of Time and Tower of Illusion.
Act 3: Aiden's attempts to expose the conspiracy, the climax of the conflict, and the resolution of the story.
2. Divide each Act into scenes or sequences:
Scenes are the building blocks of your story. Identify key events or scenes in each act. For instance, in Act 1, a key scene could be the emissaries' visit to Aiden's village and his test.

3. Develop a Chapter Outline:
Based on these scenes, develop an outline for your chapters. One or more scenes could form a chapter, depending on the pace and flow you want. Remember, chapters are flexible and can be rearranged as you develop your story.

4. Write Chapter Summaries:
Write a brief summary for each chapter based on the scenes it includes. This gives you a clear road map to follow as you write, and you can always refer back to it.

5. Start Writing:
Choose a chapter that you feel particularly drawn to — it doesn't have to be the first one — and start writing. Scrivener is a fantastic tool that allows you to write your chapters as individual sections that you can easily move around.

6. Review and Refine:
Once you have a draft, review it. Are the plot points clear? Are the characters' motivations understandable? Does the pacing feel right? Edit and refine your work, chapter by chapter.

Remember, writing is a process, and it's okay to make changes and revisions. The most important thing is to get started. Once you have something on the page, you can work with it and improve it. Happy writing!</Text>

            <Title>Owl's Watch</Title>
            <Text>To those who dwell in the villages below, the Owl's Watch is but a soft, distant glow suspended in the nightly fog, a lighthouse lost in a sea of clouds. It evokes wonder, curiosity, and no small measure of mystique, for the only sign of its existence to the outside world is that gentle, constant luminescence that wavers like a star through the veiling mist.

When Aiden is welcomed within the cloaked tower, however, he is met with an entirely different scene. The interior of Owl's Watch is ablaze with lights - magical illuminations that fill the high-vaulted halls with a soft, ethereal glow. From the grandeur of the main hall to the winding staircases and the mysterious corridors leading to countless scrying chambers, the light touches every stone, every scroll, every ancient tome.

Even more awe-inspiring are the observatories. Bathed in the soft light of countless constellations reproduced on their domed ceilings, these rooms are a testament to the Scrying wizards' deep connection with the cosmos. Crystal prisms scattered strategically around the rooms refract the lights into a mesmerizing dance of colors, creating an indoor night sky that is in a perpetual state of celestial twilight.

The contrast is striking, and to Aiden, the revelation of the tower's hidden brilliance becomes a tangible symbol of his journey. What from the outside appears as a barely visible light in the fog, from within reveals itself as a beacon of wisdom, knowledge, and awe-inspiring majesty - a reminder of how things aren't always as they appear, a lesson he will carry with him as he delves deeper into the realm of Scrying.</Text>

            <Title>Passion and Habbit</Title>
            <Text>“You are lucky in life if you find something you love.  It’s a miracle if someone will pay you to do it.”
When you start doing this - if you don’t love it you won’t finish the book or outline.  And that’s OK - if that happens it is telling you that you like this and are interested but are not passionate about it.  
If you are passionate about writing you won’t be able to help yourself - you will finish the book.  At Vanderbilt, James Patterson’s professor told him he was very good and told him he could go all the way as an author.  James spent a week at a Trappist Monastery in total silence thinking about his choice of vocation before committing.
He then gets a job in advertising to pays the bill while waking up at 5am to write for 2 hours before work.  So he would write from 5am-7am every single day and then work.  The hard part wasn’t forcing himself to write - writing truly was his passion.  The hard part was getting up at 5am.  But he forced himself to do it every day.  You need to force yourself to write for an hour a day - a half hour isn’t enough.  Find a consistent time each day.    Once it becomes a routine in your life it will be joyful and you won’t have to think about it much.
James grew up in a little river town where there wasn’t a hell of a lot to do.  His grandfather would take him once a week on his delivery route - delivering products to stores.  So they would pack up the truck at 4am and go on the delivery route.  During the route he would sing songs from the era.  He had a terrible voice.  But he said to James:  
“Jim, whether you become the president or just drive a truck like I do - all that matters is that when you are going to work you are singing.  If it is all pain - there is something wrong.  Tty to fix it.”
James Patterson’s first novel,The Thomas Berryman Number, won best novel - after it was turned down by 31 publishers.  That means rather objectively, 31 publishers were all wrong.  He could have stopped after 5 publishers and said “they know what they are doing” - but they didn’t know what they are doing.  They were wrong.  
In the intro to that book it says - “James Patterson wrote a million words before he wrote The Thomas Berryman number.”  It is all driven by passion.  
Some people succeed with their first book, some don’t.  James did not - his first book was not published.  He then took off for a little while, and wrote The Thomas Berryman Number.  Every short story he ever sent out - anywhere he sent it - was rejected.  But he kept moving forward and you should be prepared to do so as well.</Text>
