\f0\fs26 \cf0 To those who dwell in the villages below, the Owl's Watch is but a soft, distant glow suspended in the nightly fog, a lighthouse lost in a sea of clouds. It evokes wonder, curiosity, and no small measure of mystique, for the only sign of its existence to the outside world is that gentle, constant luminescence that wavers like a star through the veiling mist.\
\
When Aiden is welcomed within the cloaked tower, however, he is met with an entirely different scene. The interior of Owl's Watch is ablaze with lights - magical illuminations that fill the high-vaulted halls with a soft, ethereal glow. From the grandeur of the main hall to the winding staircases and the mysterious corridors leading to countless scrying chambers, the light touches every stone, every scroll, every ancient tome.\
\
Even more awe-inspiring are the observatories. Bathed in the soft light of countless constellations reproduced on their domed ceilings, these rooms are a testament to the Scrying wizards' deep connection with the cosmos. Crystal prisms scattered strategically around the rooms refract the lights into a mesmerizing dance of colors, creating an indoor night sky that is in a perpetual state of celestial twilight.\
\
The contrast is striking, and to Aiden, the revelation of the tower's hidden brilliance becomes a tangible symbol of his journey. What from the outside appears as a barely visible light in the fog, from within reveals itself as a beacon of wisdom, knowledge, and awe-inspiring majesty - a reminder of how things aren't always as they appear, a lesson he will carry with him as he delves deeper into the realm of Scrying.}
