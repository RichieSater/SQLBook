PRIOR TO THE SCENE
Ava, the village herbalist's dynamic and perceptive daughter, has been a fixture in Aiden's life since childhood. With her waves of chestnut hair and eyes reflecting the tranquil hue of the river, she is a living testament to their homeland's beauty. She navigates a world of therapeutic herbs and healing concoctions, her evenings filled with prayers to the Earth â€“ a universe that has always intrigued Aiden.

Their relationship is a woven tapestry of shared dreams, hearty laughter, good-natured banter, and a subtly blossoming affection. While Aiden tends to be more reserved, Ava is an open book. Her fondness for Aiden is evident in her radiant smiles, thoughtful gestures, and the spark that lights her eyes when she looks at him.

Aiden and Ava spend many tranquil evenings together in her verdant garden. As twilight unfurls its calm, they find solace among the whispering herbs. Aiden assists Ava with the plants, his curiosity piqued by her vast knowledge and the reverence she shows towards nature's healing powers.

It is during these intimate moments that Ava's feelings for Aiden become particularly pronounced. The affectionate glances she casts his way as they share stories under the stars, the fleeting touches as they exchange garden tools, and her unwavering interest in his work in the candle shop are clear indications of her deep-seated affection.

One memorable evening, Ava gifts Aiden a candle infused with a rare herb. "For a brighter light and pleasant dreams," she murmurs, a soft blush tinting her cheeks. Aiden accepts the gift, their fingers brushing momentarily, his heart catching at the tender sentiment. His warm smile of gratitude makes Ava's heart flutter in response.

Through Ava, we explore a character who embodies courage and love, unafraid to express her feelings. Her palpable affection for Aiden encourages him to gradually acknowledge his own emotions, adding a hint of sweet romance to their intertwined narrative.
