\f0\fs26 \cf0 X.  The Visit\
\
As he moved, whispers spread like wildfire, his name uttered in hushed reverence. "Orion...he's from the Owl's Watch." Orion's gaze swept over the crowd, and for a moment, Aiden felt a peculiar chill as their eyes met. Something about his gaze felt probing, almost like he was trying to read him.\
\
In the days that followed, Elder Orion's attention seemed oddly focused on Aiden. He was there when Aiden was at the bakery, and again at the candle maker's workshop, and once more when Aiden was with Ava near the brook. His presence felt disconcerting, even more so when their eyes met.\
\
One day, while Aiden was alone, closing the candle shop for the day, Elder Orion approached him. "Aiden, isn't it?" he began, his voice deep and resonant.\
\
Taken aback, Aiden nodded, "Yes, sir. Can I help you with something?"\
\
"Perhaps," Elder Orion replied cryptically. "I've noticed you around, and I must admit, your curiosity is...interesting."}
