Starting a large project like this can be daunting, but remember that every story, no matter how complex, is just a series of steps taken one at a time. Here's a simple process you can follow to go from your world-building and plot outline to actual chapters:

1. Break down your story into Acts:
The classic three-act structure works well for many stories, where Act 1 is the setup, Act 2 is the confrontation, and Act 3 is the resolution. For example:

Act 1: Aiden's life in his village, the visit from the emissaries, his discovery of his gift, and his journey to the Tower of Scrying.
Act 2: Aiden's training at the tower, learning about scrying and the Astral Plane, discovering the intrigue between the Tower of Time and Tower of Illusion.
Act 3: Aiden's attempts to expose the conspiracy, the climax of the conflict, and the resolution of the story.
2. Divide each Act into scenes or sequences:
Scenes are the building blocks of your story. Identify key events or scenes in each act. For instance, in Act 1, a key scene could be the emissaries' visit to Aiden's village and his test.

3. Develop a Chapter Outline:
Based on these scenes, develop an outline for your chapters. One or more scenes could form a chapter, depending on the pace and flow you want. Remember, chapters are flexible and can be rearranged as you develop your story.

4. Write Chapter Summaries:
Write a brief summary for each chapter based on the scenes it includes. This gives you a clear road map to follow as you write, and you can always refer back to it.

5. Start Writing:
Choose a chapter that you feel particularly drawn to — it doesn't have to be the first one — and start writing. Scrivener is a fantastic tool that allows you to write your chapters as individual sections that you can easily move around.

6. Review and Refine:
Once you have a draft, review it. Are the plot points clear? Are the characters' motivations understandable? Does the pacing feel right? Edit and refine your work, chapter by chapter.

Remember, writing is a process, and it's okay to make changes and revisions. The most important thing is to get started. Once you have something on the page, you can work with it and improve it. Happy writing!
