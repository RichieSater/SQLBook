\f0\fs26 \cf0 For the last 5 years, Neil has been teaching at Bard College as a professor of the arts.  And each year he can teach about 25 students.  He loves teaching students to write - but the reach is rather small.  The joy of masterclass is saying this to many more people.  \
The goal of this class is to teach how to find the writers toolshed and what tools are available to writers.  It also will show you where the pitfalls are - and walk you through them safely so you come out with a better idea how to write than you did when you started.\
You will learn that stories are important, what stories are, and how to make stories that matter. You will get tips and exercises and a little push forward that you might not have had otherwise.}
